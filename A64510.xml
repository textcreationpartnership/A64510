            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALL Human Laws are either Natural or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p>The Law of Nature, which is alſo the Moral Law, is at all times and in all places the ſame, and ſo will always continue.</p>
            <p>By Civil Laws, I mean, ſuch as are eſtabliſhed by Human Policy, which with us are either Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms or Statutes; and theſe have alſo ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to Natural Laws, becauſe they are for the moſt part introduced by the concurrent Reaſon of Men; and Reaſon is the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p>Cuſtoms are made by Time and Uſage, and do thereby obtain the force of Laws in particular places
<pb facs="tcp:37883:3"/>and Nations; but no otherwiſe than upon ſuppoſition that they were reaſonable at the beginning. To theſe may be added ſuch Laws which are uſually called <hi>Reſponſa Prudentum,</hi> which, together with Cuſtoms, make a great part of our Municipal Laws.</p>
            <p>And becauſe 'tis impoſſible that future Evils ſhould be foreſeen by the Wiſdom of Mankind ſo as to prevent them; therefore 'tis very reaſonable that poſitive Laws ſhould be inſtituted by the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power, which we call <hi>Statutes;</hi> and thoſe are either Commands or Prohibitions, always enacted upon ſome preſent Emergencies, and may be altered or repealed according as the Manners of Men change, or as the Conjuncture of Affairs require for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good.</p>
            <p>I do not find this Nation was governed by any ſettled Laws from the time of <hi>William</hi> called <hi>the Conqueror,</hi> till 9 <hi>H.</hi> 3. but by the irregular Power of the <hi>Norman</hi> King, and of thoſe who immediately ſucceeded him.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, he ſwore to preſerve <hi>approbatas &amp; anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas Leges Angliae;</hi> but 'tis as true, that the ſame Force, which compelled our Forefathers to ſubmit, did likewiſe exact their Obedience to the Cuſtoms of <hi>Normandy,</hi> ſome of which we retain to this very day.</p>
            <p>It was then a term of Reproach to be called <hi>an Engliſhman,</hi> as if that denomination imported to be a Slave. This made the leſſer Barons (that is, the Freeholders, or thoſe which had ſuch Lordſhips which are now called <hi>Court-Barons</hi>) take up Arms to regain their ancient Rights, and by that means they obtained a Grant of their old Laws from ſome
<pb facs="tcp:37883:3"/>of thoſe Kings, which was called <hi>Magna Charta Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatum;</hi> but living in a tumultuous Age they did never quietly enjoy thoſe Liberties; for notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Charter, many Infringements were made upon them, which they continued in Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, inſomuch that in the Seventeenth Year of King <hi>John</hi> they delivered to that King a Schedule of their ancient Cuſtoms in Writing, deſiring that he would eſtabliſh them by another Grant, which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>But this Charter was as little obſerved as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for the <hi>Norman</hi> Cuſtoms did ſtill interfere with St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, and the People were miſerably divided by thoſe Innovations till <hi>Anno</hi> 9 <hi>H.</hi> 3. the Great Charter was eſtabliſhed by <hi>Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From that time thoſe ancient Laws and Cuſtoms were had again in repute, they were revived by that Grant, which was only declaratory of them; and becauſe a more exact Obedience and Conformity might be given to them for the future, therefore did his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, the good King <hi>Edward</hi> I. encourage the Lawyers in his time to reduce them into Order and Writing, which was done accordingly about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his Reign by <hi>John Breton,</hi> not the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> but a Judge of the <hi>King's Bench;</hi> for, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> has obſerved, the Biſhop of that Name died <hi>Anno</hi> 3 <hi>E.</hi> 1. And in that Book which is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Breton,</hi> the Statute of <hi>W.</hi> 2. is cited, which was made 13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. and therefore it could not be pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Biſhop, unleſs he could quote a Statute which was not made till above ten years after his Death.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:37883:4"/>
            <p>This is one of the firſt Syſtems extant of our Laws. 'Tis true, the Book called <hi>The Mirror of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> was written before, but many Additions were made to it in this King's Reign by <hi>Andrew Horn,</hi> a learned Man in that Age.</p>
            <p>There was likewiſe a ſmall Tract then written by Sir <hi>Ralph Hengham,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas,</hi> which only treats of Eſſoins and Defaults in Writs of Right, Writs of Aſſize and Dower, and therefore cannot be called a Body of our Laws.</p>
            <p>I muſt admit that two ſuch Books were written by the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Glanvil</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Bracton,</hi> the one in the Reign of <hi>Henry the Second,</hi> and the other in the time of <hi>Henry the Third,</hi> but not one more of that Nature almoſt in the ſpace of two hundred Years; for I do not think the Book which the Lord Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue</hi> wrote in the Reign of King <hi>Henry the Sixth,</hi> can be properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a Syſtem of Law:</hi> It was publiſhed by him for theſe purpoſes, firſt, to obviate the deſign of two great Favourites, the Dukes of <hi>Exeter</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who had uſed ſome endeavours to introduce the Imperial Law, and therefore he ſhewed the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Common Law above that; and in the next place, it was intended to ſoften the warlike Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the young Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> by inclining him to the Study of thoſe Laws by which he was to govern his People, and to inſtruct him in ſome Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences therein.</p>
            <p>The Abridgment by Baron <hi>Statham</hi> and the Year-Books are for the moſt part made up with Caſes then depending in the ſeveral Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and with the Opinions and Reſolutions of Judges,
<pb facs="tcp:37883:4"/>which I rather call <hi>Reſponſa Prudentum</hi> than <hi>Syſtems of Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Attempt in that kind was made by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Littleton</hi> in the Seventh Year of <hi>Edward the Fourth,</hi> who hath taught ſucceeding Ages with great Judgment and Learning in his Profeſſion; but 'tis now two hundred and thirty Years ſince he wrote, and many alterations have been made in the Law ſince his time.</p>
            <p>I only mention theſe things to ſhew the neceſſity of new Books, and that the old Volumes are not ſo uſeful now as formerly, becauſe many of the great Titles, of which they were compoſed, are now quite diſuſed; they are mentioned by my Lord <hi>Hales</hi> in his Preface to the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Roll</hi>'s Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I ſhall not repeat, and thoſe very Titles make the greateſt part of Juſtice <hi>Littleton</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures.</p>
            <p>But amongſt all the Old Tenures and Cuſtoms I admire that of <hi>Burrough Engliſh</hi> ſhould ſtill remain amongſt us; 'tis a Cuſtom contrary to the poſitive Laws of God, and which inverts the very order of Nature; it was introduced amongſt us in a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Age, and by a very wicked and adulterous practice after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lords of certain Lands which were held of them in <hi>Villenage</hi> did uſually lye with their Tenants Wives the firſt Night after Marriage; this Uſage was continued after thoſe very Lands were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Freemen, who in time obtained this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom on purpoſe that their eldeſt Sons (who might be their Lord's Baſtards) ſhould be incapable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit their Eſtates.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:37883:5"/>
            <p>I could never yet find any tolerable reaſon for the ſupport or continuance of this Cuſtom; but the Reaſon of it, which was given by a learned Lawyer, is becauſe the youngeſt is leaſt able to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; certainly he could never mean Ability of Body, becauſe 'tis frequently ſeen that the youngeſt Son is the Champion of the Family; and if he intended A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in Eſtate, I would fain know what the elder Brother hath to defend himſelf, when by this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cuſtom the youngeſt is entitled to the whole.</p>
            <p>I am not ſetting up for a Reformer of the Law or the Abuſes of it; 'tis not a work for a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but rather for a Committee of able and skilful Men of that Profeſſion appointed by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Neither will I object againſt the Practice of it as heretofore in the year 1654. it hath been done, <hi>viz.</hi> That great part conſiſts in known and apparent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths; That a <hi>Common Recovery</hi> ought not to be ſuffered in a Chriſtian Nation, becauſe 'tis <hi>Fictio Juris,</hi> which is an abuſe of the Law; That when 'tis ſuffered at the Bar by the Tenant and Demandant, there is ſcarce a true word in all the <hi>Colloquium</hi> amongſt the Serjeants, and that therefore an Eſtate Tail may more righteouſly be diſcontinued by a Feoffment with Livery than by the Statute <hi>de Donis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Language of thoſe times: They found fault likewiſe with that wicked Proceſs of <hi>Latitat,</hi> that it was framed upon a ſuppoſed Falſhood by ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting of a Bill of <hi>Middleſex</hi> ſued out which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver actually done; and that the Defendant could not be taken there, becauſe he is ſculking about in another County, which is ſeldom or never true, and
<pb facs="tcp:37883:5"/>preſently afterwards he is <hi>in Cuſtodia Mareſcalli,</hi> which is as falſe as the reſt; and that <hi>John Doe</hi> and <hi>Richard Roe</hi> are Pledges <hi>de Proſequendo,</hi> when there are no ſuch Men in Nature; theſe things and many more I could name of the like Nature, I eſteem as trivial Matters, for no Injury is done to any Body by ſuch Formalities.</p>
            <p>But when there is danger of Corruption in that which was originally intended for the great preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative of our Liberties, I mean in Trials by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Juries, it may be worth a great deal of Pains and Study to propoſe ſome effectual means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, which is the chief end of this Preface, that you may at ſome time employ your Thoughts in ſo uſeful a piece of Service to your Country.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only give you a ſhort Hiſtory of ſuch Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Opinions, that ſuch Trials were had in this Nation by a Jury of Twelve Men long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of the <hi>Engliſh Saxons,</hi> though the Writers in thoſe Ages give no account of this Matter.</p>
            <p>This is collected from that great eſteem the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> had for the number 12. becauſe of ſo many Signs in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> thoſe People applying themſelves chiefly to the Study of Aſtrology.</p>
            <p>That from them this Number came to the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Greece,</hi> where <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf was tryed for a Murder, by a Jury of that Number, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by an equality of Votes, which is the firſt Trial mentioned in Hiſtory by a Jury of Twelve.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:37883:6"/>
            <p>That the <hi>Greeks</hi> frequenting this Iſland, to export our Tin, became acquainted with the Natives, and in proceſs of time cohabited with them, who being a more polite People did introduce this way of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als here; and 'tis very probable that ſome of our Cuſtoms came from them, becauſe ſome of our Law-Terms, as <hi>Chirographer, Protonotary,</hi> and many more are derived from their Language.</p>
            <p>After the Conqueſt of <hi>Greece</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> new Laws were inſtituted by them to govern this Nation, which was then a Province to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors; and though ſuch Trials were then diſuſed, yet they had that Number in ſeveral ſubordinate forms of their Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Afterwards when that great Empire declined, when the <hi>Britains</hi> were forſaken by them, and left to the Depredations of the <hi>Pagan Saxons,</hi> then were other Trials introduced by that barbarous People, which was by <hi>Battle</hi> in doubtful caſes, and when that could not be joyned, then Purgations by <hi>Ordeal</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; Trials very agreeable to the uncultivated Temper of thoſe People.</p>
            <p>Thus it continued till about two hundred years before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt; and then <hi>Ethelbert</hi> an <hi>Engliſh Saxon</hi> King received Chriſtianity, and by his Example the Diſpoſitions of the People were quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied into a more civil and peaceable deportment; then were thoſe Trials for the moſt part laid aſide, and that good King being at <hi>Wantage,</hi> (now a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Town in <hi>Berk-ſhire,</hi>) did there by the Advice of his Council ordain that Trials ſhould be had by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries conſiſting of twelve Men, which Law doth ſtill continue.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:37883:6"/>
            <p>But notwithſtanding ſuch were then and are ſtill the beſt and moſt effectual Methods to diſcover the Truth, yet <hi>Ordeals</hi> were uſed here for above one hundred and fifty years after the Conqueſt; and then about the beginning of the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 3. were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But Combates continued here till 6 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult are the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to part with any ancient Uſage of their Anceſtors, though in no wiſe ſuitable to them who live in a more polite and learned Age.</p>
            <p>Juries being thus confined to the Number 12. it was afterwards enacted by the Statute of 2. <hi>H.</hi> 5. That all Jurors returned for Trials of Iſſues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould have 40 <hi>s. per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Law continued for the ſpace of an hundred and ninety years, or thereabouts, and then the Wiſdom of the Nation conſidering that to be a very mean Eſtate for the ſupport of a Jury-Man, a farther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was made by a Statute <hi>Anno</hi> 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> That ſuch Jurors ſhould have 4 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the Law ſtood for above an hundred years, in all which time this Kingdom hath been growing in Riches, its Trade is now extended to moſt parts of the World; and as that hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, ſo the Price of our Lands, the Value of our Rents, of our natural Commodities, and of all our Manufactures have wonderfully encreaſed, ſo that a Man of 4 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> is now in ſo mean a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life that he is no longer to be entruſted with the Trial of an ordinary Cauſe, and therefore by the Statute of 4 <hi>&amp;</hi> 5 <hi>Willielmi &amp; Mariae</hi> ſuch Jurors are to have 10 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:37883:7"/>
            <p>Now upon a moderate computation of the price of Proviſions and other Neceſſaries in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. and how they encreaſed in Value from that time till the Queen's Reign, it may be reaſonably affirmed that 40 <hi>s. per Annum</hi> about the time when that King lived, would bear an equal proportion to 40 <hi>l.</hi> a year in her Reign; and if ſo, it may as reaſonably be ſaid, that 4 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in her days would almoſt bear the like proportion to 80 <hi>l. per annum</hi> now, becauſe of the vaſt encreaſe of Riches by Commerce, and otherwiſe, in this laſt Age; and ſuch an Eſtate doth now qualifie a Man to be of the Grand Jury.</p>
            <p>The 40 <hi>s. per annum</hi> in King <hi>H</hi>'s. Reign was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a ſufficient Eſtate to ſupply all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Neceſſities of Life, Wheat being then ſold for 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Quarter, and good <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> Wine for 40 <hi>s. per</hi> Tun. It was an Age when 20 Marks <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> was a very good Allowance to maintain a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> but too great a Charge for a Commoner to bear; and therefore the Lord Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue</hi> tells us, that none but the Sons of Noblemen <hi>in Hoſpitiis illis Leges addiſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jurors in thoſe days were all Knights, but are now mean and illiterate perſons; for 'tis a very poor Eſtate which qualifies them for that Service. How can Matters of Fact, which often require great Examination, be tryed by Men of ſuch narrow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, which are generally found amongſt Men of 10 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> for ſo it will be ſo long as the Degrees of Fortune make ſuch a vaſt inequality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:37883:7"/>
            <p>Experience teacheth us, that Men of ſuch low Fortunes, and whoſe Education is generally amongſt the Beaſts of the Plow, have not the ſame ſenſe of Honour and Vertue with Men of more elevated Qualities and Converſation; there muſt be danger of Subornation and Perjury among ſuch Jurors: And what will the villanous Judgment in Attaint ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie? I mean in reſpect to their Eſtates, <hi>viz. That their Goods be confiſcate, their Lands and Poſſeſſions ſeiſed into the King's Hands, their Houſes demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their Woods felled, and their Meadows plowed:</hi> This is a very dreadful Sentence to a Man of a good Eſtate, which by the very Form of this old Judgment every Juror was ſuppoſed to have; but 'tis an empty ſound to a Man of 10 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> who cannot have all thoſe Poſſeſſions, and but a very ſmall proportion of either.</p>
            <p>It may be therefore thought neceſſary, that a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proviſion be made that none ſhould be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled to try ſuch Iſſues, but Men of 40 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or at leaſt ſuch as like the Jurors in Attaint, <hi>qui multa majora habent Patrimonia,</hi> than what will qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie a Petty Juror at this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following Collection is the Product of your Labours: It was borrowed from you at the Bar, and 'tis but juſt to reſtore it.</p>
            <p>I know Men have generally very faint Inclinations to approve any Writings beſide their own, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom declare in favour of a Book till they hear what
<pb facs="tcp:37883:8"/>ſucceſs it has in the World; and even then are biaſſed by the Multitude, who very often condemn without reading, or read without Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>I have heard it often objected (though I am ſtill to learn upon what accompt) that we have too many Printed Books of the Law already, and that it was more certain and intelligible when fewer Volumes of it were publiſhed.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs ſome of the late Reports are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected with very little Judgment.</p>
            <p>But ſtill there is a neceſſity of new Books, tho' not of ſuch; for I would feign know how any Lawyer can now be able to adviſe his Client with the help and direction only of the Old Books? 'Tis true, we have but few of them, but 'tis becauſe in former Ages all Cauſes (where the thing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand did not exceed 40 <hi>s.</hi>) were tried either in the County Court, in the Hundred Court or in the Court Baron of the Mannor: In thoſe days the great Courts of Record at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were not ſo full of Suitors as now.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Bracton</hi> wrote, the Juſtices in <hi>Eyre</hi> (who had the ſame Power with our Juſtices of Aſſiſe) went their Circuits but once in ſeven years; and a long time afterwards, even in the Reign of King <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> the Judges would often riſe from the Bench in Term-time without hearing a Motion, or trying of a Cauſe; and I think the Practice did not much encreaſe till this laſt Age; for <hi>Anno</hi> 10 <hi>Eliz.</hi> there was but one Serjeant at the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> Barr for a whole Term together, and that was Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Bendloes;</hi> and I do not read that he had any
<pb facs="tcp:37883:8"/>Buſineſs there; Nay at that time the Court of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> had no greater ſhare of Practice than the Courts of the Common Law; for in the two and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Year of King <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> being then Lord Chancellor, did uſually read all the Bills, which were exhibited into that Court; but Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is now ſo much encreaſed, that all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil can ſcarce find time enough to read the Briefs of ſuch Bills which are filed every Term.</p>
            <p>But the Law hath now its Reſidence in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Hall,</hi> moſt Cauſes of Value are there determined, and the great Number of Country Attornies in our days, who (according to my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Opinion) by dayly multiplying Suits have ſo wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Buſineſs of thoſe Courts, that it ſeems very neceſſary that the judicial determinations there ſhould by new Books be tranſmitted to future Ages.</p>
            <p>And though ſome Caſes in this Collection, which were adjudged in the late Reign, may not have the Authority of Preſidents, becauſe they taſte a little of the Times wherein the Adminiſtration of Juſtice was not ſo nicely regarded, as the Diſpenſation of ſuch things which were then thought Political Rights, yet the Reader will find ſome good Arguments of Learned Men then at the Bar who endeavoured to ſupport our ſinking Laws.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledge, that if Men were juſt, honeſt and impartial to themſelves and others, there would be no occaſion for Books of this nature; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſo, I will not make an Apology for the Publiſhing of this. I think the Book, (being
<pb facs="tcp:37883:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:37883:10"/>done with ſo much Care) may be of good uſe to the Profeſſors of the Law; but ſubmit it to your Judgments. I confeſs, I am led by my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to Affairs of this nature, though my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances diſingage me from the ſuſpicion of being an Author.</p>

                  <hi>AN Action of</hi> Treſpaſs <hi>was formerly brought for taking of Goods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and upon Not-guilty pleaded,</hi>

                  <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant had a Verdict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame Plaintiff now brought</hi> Trover <hi>againſt the ſame Defendant for thoſe Goods.</hi>

                  <hi>Whether a Iudgment in Treſpaſs</hi> vi &amp; armis <hi>may be pleaded in Bar to an Action of</hi> Trover <hi>for the ſame Goods?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Caſe was argued by Mr.</hi> Saunders <hi>for the Plaintiff; and by Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>for the Defendant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to prove that it was no Bar,</hi>

                  <hi>a Caſe was cited to be adjudged in the</hi> Common Pleas <hi>in the</hi> 20th <hi>year of King</hi> James, <hi>which was an Action of</hi> Trover <hi>and</hi> Converſion <hi>of one hundred Sheep: The Defendant pleaded a former Iudgment in Treſpaſs brought againſt him,</hi> quare cepit &amp; abduxit <hi>thoſe Sheep, and that the Plaintiff in that Action recovered</hi> 2 d. <hi>damages, and that both Actions were for the ſame thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37883:13"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff replied, that the two pence damages were recoverd for the chaſing, and not for the value of the Cattle; and upon a Demurrer had Iudgment: For the ſmalneſs of the damages im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it was for the chaſing, and it ſhall therefore be intended that he had his Cattle again, and that the Converſion was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord</hi> Coke <hi>in</hi> Ferrer's Caſe <hi>tells us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ferrer<hi>'s Caſe,</hi> 6 Co. 7. Cro. Eliz. 676. Co. Ent. 39. Cro. Jac. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>that a Recovery by Verdict, Confeſſion, or upon a Demurrer in a perſonal Action is a good Bar to an Action of the like nature, and for the ſame thing; but that muſt be underſtood where the ſame Evidence will maintain both the Actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtice</hi> Croke <hi>reports the ſame Caſe to be ended by Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but that it was the Opinion of my Lord</hi> Anderſon <hi>and Iuſtice</hi> Glanvil, <hi>that</hi> Trover <hi>and</hi> Treſpaſs <hi>are Actions of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natures, and one may be brought where the other cannot be maintained; as upon a demand and denial</hi> Trover <hi>will lie, but not</hi> Treſpaſs vi &amp; armis, <hi>becauſe the taking was not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore it may be well intended that when the Plaintiff brought</hi> Treſpaſs <hi>he was miſtaken in that Action, and being in the wrong, was barred; but that will be no Bar where a right Action is brought; as if I deliver a Bond to another for advice, who refuſing to redeliver it, I bring an Action of</hi> Treſpaſs <hi>and am barred either by Verdict or Demurrer, yet I may bring</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
               <p>Treſpaſs <hi>and</hi> Detinue <hi>are not the ſame Actions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro Def.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore a Iudgment in one ſhall be no bar to the other; but where two Actions are brought for one thing to be recovered, in ſuch caſe a Recovery in one ſhall be a bar to the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no ſubſtantial difference between</hi> Treſpaſs <hi>and</hi> Trover; <hi>for the diſpoſing of the Goods in the one caſe is the ſame with the</hi> Converſion <hi>in the other; the taking</hi> vi &amp; armis <hi>and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the</hi> Converſion <hi>are both tortious, and therefore either Action may be well brought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But for the Reaſons given by the Plaintiffs Council, he had Iudgment by the Opinion of the Chief Iuſtice and the other two Iudges,</hi> Jones <hi>and</hi> Raymond; <hi>of which Iuſtice</hi> Dolben <hi>did very much doubt.</hi>

                  <hi>Which Indictment was tryed at the Aſſiſes at</hi> Briſtol <hi>by</hi> Niſi Prius, <hi>and the Defendants found guilty; and thereupon Sir</hi> Robert Atkins, <hi>one of the Defendants</hi> (having then lately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Caſe, been one of the Judges of the Common Pleas, but then diſcharged of his Place after eight years ſitting there ſecure) <hi>came into the Court of</hi> Kings Bench, <hi>and in Arreſt of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment argued his own Caſe, not as Council, nor at the Bar, but in the Court in his Cloak, having a Chair ſet for him by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Lord Chief Iuſtice, and ſaid as followeth;</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:37883:14"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Indictment in the firſt place mentions the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of King</hi> H. 7. <hi>made to the Mayor and Commonalty of</hi> Briſtol, <hi>that the Mayor with two Aldermen (ſuch as he ſhould chooſe) ſhould by their diſcretions, according to Law, puniſh ſuch as ſhould make debate and diſcord at the Elections of Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They have not purſued this courſe againſt us, but gone the ordinary way of Indictment, and therefore I ſhall not need to ſpeak to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Indictment in the next place proceeds to mention Letters Patents of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>granted to the Mayor and Commonalty in the</hi> 23d. <hi>year of her Reign, which provides, that there ſhall be twelve Aldermen, and how upon the death or removal of an Alderman, a new one ſhould be choſen, that is, by the Mayor and the ſurviving Aldermen, and the greater number of them, being call'd together (as the Indictment ſuggeſts) by the Summons of the Mayor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The whole Indictment and the Offence, we are charged with being grounded upon theſe Letters Patents, I ſhall apply my ſelf to ſpeak to it; for our Crime is in the undue electing of an Alderman, namely not being ſummoned together for that purpoſe by the Mayor, and doing it in his abſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I muſt deſire the Court to obſerve in what manner the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Letters Patents is introduced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Matter and Queſtion before us is concerning the Election of an Alderman for the City of</hi> Briſtol, <hi>which concerns the very being, and ſucceſſion, and continuance of the Corporation: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more nearly concern it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The defects I obſerve in the frame of this Indictment are theſe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It does not ſo much as ſay or alledge, that</hi> Briſtol <hi>is</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqua Villa, <hi>or</hi> antiqua Civitas, <hi>or that there was, or yet is, any Corporation at all there, nor what it does conſiſt of (if there be any) nor by what name they are called; whether there ought to be a Mayor or not; whether their Corporation be by Charter, or Preſcription.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this Court cannot judicially take notice that there is any Corporation there, or what it is, unleſs it had been ſhewn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if there be no Corporation, and no Mayor of right, then our meeting to chooſe an Alderman without his Summons, and in his abſence, is no undue nor irregular Proceeding: It cannot appear to the Court whether the Mayors Summons and preſence at the Election be neceſſary or not.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37883:15"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now in all legal Proceedings that any way concern a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, it is conſtantly averr'd and alledged that there is a Corporation, and what it is, and how erected; and the leaſt that can be in any Caſe is, to ſay that it is</hi> antiqua Villa <hi>or</hi> antiqua Civitas, <hi>where the Corporation extends to a Town or City which make any Preſcription, or ſet forth any Cuſtom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus we find it in the</hi> Caſe of the City of York, Dyer 279. plac' 10. <hi>in the Caſe of a Cuſtom of Foreign bought and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſold, They Preſcribe in being a Corporation. So in</hi> Latches Rep. 229. Harris's Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> James Bagg's Caſe, 11 Co. f. 94. <hi>A Caſe of a</hi> Writ of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <hi>to Reſtore a Capital Burgeſs to his Place and Office of a Capital Burgeſs in</hi> Plimouth; <hi>the Writ was directed to the Mayor and Commonalty of</hi> Plimouth; <hi>the very Words of the Writ ſuppoſe a Corporation, and ſhew what their Name is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Return thereupon by the Mayor and Commonalty is,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>granted to the Mayor and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, that the Mayor and Recorder ſhould be Iuſtices of the Peace, and that</hi> James Baggs <hi>was a Capital Burgeſs, and did miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demean himſelf towards the Mayor, and thereupon he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the printed Margent of that Caſe, (which I ſuppoſe is my Lord</hi> Cokes <hi>own Opinion</hi>) <hi>it is ſaid, That in their Return they firſt ought to preſcribe, That there hath been a Corporation of a Mayor and Commonalty time out of the Memory of Man; and not to begin with the mention of a Grant made to a Coporation, as the Indictment does in our Caſe; and not ſhew the Original and Erection of it, either by Preſcription or Charter. And Mr.</hi> Trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>(a Learned Man) in his abridging of</hi> James Bagg's Caſe <hi>bids his Reader obſerve this Marginal Note.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet in that Caſe the Return was but in anſwer to the Writ of Reſtitution, which Writ it ſelf admitted there was a Corporation, and directs the Writ to them by Name; yet by the Opinion there, it was a defect in the Return not to ſhew that they were by Preſcription.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> if it be neceſſary upon a Return of a Writ of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>to ſet forth how they came to be incorporated; to which Return there</hi> can be no Traverſe taken, nor no pleading to it, <hi>as has been held by ſome; how much more in ſuch a Caſe as</hi> ours of an Indictment, <hi>which muſt be traverſed and pleaded to, and therefore ought to be more exact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That was in a Caſe of removing of a chief Member (a Capital Burgeſs of a Corporation; ours is in a Caſe of the chooſing in of a chief Member (an Alderman) into a Corporation; ſo that ours is much reſembling that Caſe in that reſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37883:15"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Another thing wherein the Indictment is faulty, is this,</hi> viz. In the manner of introducing the mention of theſe Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Queen Elizabeth, <hi>upon which the Indictment is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and upon the Conſtruction of which the Caſe depends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Indictment</hi> does not ſay poſitively and directly <hi>that Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>made or granted any Letters Patents to the Mayor and Commonalty of</hi> Briſtol, <hi>That there ſhould be twelve Aldermen, and for the appointing how they ſhould be choſen; (upon which our Caſe ariſes) nor does it ſo much as ſay</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinetur) <hi>which would not have been enough neither, but it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces the mention of thoſe Letters Patents no otherwiſe than by theſe Words,</hi> viz. Secundum Privilegia conceſſa per Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teras Patentes, &amp;c. <hi>There were or ought to be twelve Aldermen,</hi> Et ſecundum eadem Privilegia ſic ut praefertur conceſſa per to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum tempus praedictum <hi>after the death of an Alderman, the Mayor and the ſurviving Aldermen</hi> &amp; eorum major pars ad ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitionem ejuſdem Majoris convocati eligerunt &amp; eligere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueverunt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now this is no poſitive and direct ſhewing that there ought to be any Aldermen, nor how they ſhould be choſen; but it is no more than the Opinion and Conceit of the Iury that found the Indictment upon their peruſal of the Letters Patents, which were produced in Evidence to them; the Iury take it by way of Collection out of a Record, of which they are no proper Iudges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this being</hi> in an Indictment <hi>which is</hi> the Kings Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>and ought to be very exact and certain, and which is in a criminal proceeding to which the Parties muſt plead, and if convict, are liable to Fine and Impriſonment; the Law is more curious in this, than where Parties do agree</hi> civiliter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all Criminal Proceedings muſt be very exact and certain, is proved by this,</hi> (viz.) None of the Statutes of Jeofails <hi>would ever help them but by expreſs Words except and exclude them from the benefit of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is ſaid in</hi> Long's Caſe, 5 Co. 120, 121. <hi>That,</hi> If in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations between Party and Party for Lands or Goods, there muſt be great certainty expres'd <hi>a fortiore,</hi> ſays that Caſe, <hi>muſt it be</hi> ſo in Indictments, <hi>which are the Kings Counts or Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to which the Party ſhall anſwer, they ought to be full and not taken by Intendment, or to be by way of Argument; ſo it is held in</hi> Leeches Caſe, Cro. Jac. 167. <hi>and in Sir</hi> William Fitz-Williams's Caſe, Cro. Jac. 19, 20.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37883:16"/>
               <p>Object. <hi>If it be objected, That the Indictment is but the finding of a Iury, who are the</hi> Lay-gentz <hi>(as we call them) and they know not the forms of Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>The Fact indeed is found by the Iury, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe is to have the Iury conſent to mend the Form, and the Kings Council are addiſed-with in the drawing of it, and after 'tis found; and ſometimes the Iudges peruſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Indictment proceeds on and ſays, That continually after that time (which muſt refer to the date of the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Queen</hi> Elizabeth) <hi>the Recorder and the reſt of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen were and ought to be</hi> de privato Concilio.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(I have been Recorder there above theſe one and twenty years and never knew my ſelf to be a Privy Councellor till now.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Indictment (unhappily) ſays</hi> de privato Concilio Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joris; <hi>there the Word</hi> Majoris <hi>(as big as it is) is but</hi> Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus diminuens, <hi>it makes us but Privy Councellors to the Mayor. But this is a miſtake too; for the Recorder and Aldermen are not a Privy Council to the Mayor, but the Mayor and they are a Council to the City. The like to this too appears in the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Margent of</hi> James Baggs's Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Clerk who drew this Indictment, or the Council, who ever it was, thought they could not exalt the Mayor of</hi> Briſtol <hi>high enough, unleſs they made him a Prince and furniſhed him with a Privy Council, and to fill the Kingdom again with a great many</hi> Reguli <hi>or petty Kings, as it was amongſt the</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons <hi>before the coming of the</hi> Romans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is part of the Misdemeanour charged upon</hi> James Baggs, <hi>that he did</hi> Ironically <hi>ſay to the Mayor of</hi> Plimouth, You are ſome Prince are you not? <hi>Now to ſay it to a Mayor in good earneſt, as this Indictment does, I take to be much worſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Indictment having made the Recorder and Aldermen</hi> to be of Mr. Mayors Privy Council, <hi>it goes on, and lays it down for Law or Vſage,</hi> That by all the time aforeſaid (<hi>which is ſtill from the date of the Patent of Queen</hi> Elizabeth) ſuch Privy Council have not accuſtomed, nor ought not to be called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to tranſact any Buſineſs that belongs to the Council <hi>(we muſt ſuppoſe the chooſing an Alderman is ſuch Buſineſs)</hi> unleſs by the Summons and in the preſence of the Mayor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But upon what ground does the Indictment lay this down for a Rule? Is it becauſe the Letters Patents ſo direct? If ſo, I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37883:16"/>agree it is a clear Caſe, for the Letters Patents that create a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration may mould and frame, and form its own Creature as it pleaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But then the Indictment ought to have alledg'd it poſitively, that the Letters Patents do ſo provide,</hi> which it does not; <hi>but the Indictment ſpeaks it by a kind of implication and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but not poſitively, nor directly: It ſays, that continually</hi> after the time of the Charter, <hi>they have not accuſtomed to meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Mayor's Summons, and in his preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be they relye upon</hi> the Uſage and Cuſtom for it. <hi>This can be no legal Cuſtom nor Preſcription, for we know the Head and Original of it, which is but from the</hi> 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>year of Queen</hi> Elizabeth: <hi>ſo that 'tis not like the River</hi> Nile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they ſay</hi> the Uſage ſhall interpret the Charter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer. Vſage may expound very ancient Charters, where the words are obſolete and obſcure, and may bear ſeveral ſenſes; but this Charter has not ſo much as ambiguous Words, nor any thing that can hear ſuch a Conſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But at laſt we ſhall be told, That</hi> the Common Law <hi>does operate with the Charter, and requires the Mayor's Summons and Preſence to the choice of an Alderman, and alſo in all ſuch like Caſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is now the only Point to be ſpoken to, <hi>and I ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I think it will be granted, That the Mayor has</hi> no Negative Voice <hi>in the Election of an Alderman (as great a Prince, and as abſolute as the Indictment will make him;) he has but one ſingle Voice, and if the majority of the Votes be againſt his Vote, the majority muſt carry it againſt the Mayor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Words of the Charter do no more <hi>require the Mayor's Summons and Preſence than it does that of the ſenior Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Mayor is named in the Grant, out of neceſſity, <hi>it being part of the name of the Corporation to whom the Grant muſt be made. He is named</hi> out of Conformity <hi>too, he many times being none of the Aldermen, and therefore could</hi> not be included <hi>in the naming of Aldermen, but muſt therefore be named by himſelf. And beſides,</hi> I agree it is due to him out of Reverence. <hi>They uſually ſay, He repreſents the King, but that is but a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Complement to him; he has no more power than an Alderman, who is a Iuſtice, and a Iudge of the Goal-Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very as well as the Mayor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Charter had intended, <hi>That there can be no chuſing of an Alderman, but by the Summons of the Mayor, and in his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37883:17"/>preſence,</hi> it would ſurely have made him of the Quorum, <hi>in that Clauſe that provides for the Election of an Alderman; but that it does not: The only</hi> Quorum <hi>is not of the ſort of Perſons, but of the majority of the Electors,</hi> Major pars eorum <hi>(having mentioned before, the Mayor and Aldermen.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay, there is</hi> ſomething to be obſerv'd out of the <hi>Charter it ſelf,</hi> which proves that the Queen intended no ſuch thing; <hi>and that is, there are</hi> other Clauſes <hi>in the ſame Charter to other purpoſes, that do expreſſly appoint</hi> Quorums, <hi>and the Mayor and Recorder are made to be of the</hi> Quorum, <hi>which proves, That where it is not ſo expreſſed, the Mayor himſelf is not of the</hi> Quorum; <hi>and this indeed led us to that Opinion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that we proceeded to make our Election upon it: A Charter in one Clauſe of it, is beſt Expounded from other Clauſes in the ſame Charter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Clauſe that gives them power of</hi> Gaol-Delivery, <hi>the Mayor and Recorder are both of the</hi> Quorum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So in the</hi> Swearing of a New Alderman, <hi>it is expreſly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it ſhall be done before the Mayor and Recorder both.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the Clauſe that gives them power</hi> to Try Felons, <hi>and</hi> to keep a Seſſions of the Peace, <hi>it appears by the expreſs Words</hi> That it may be done in the Mayor's abſence, <hi>and without him; for there the</hi> Quorum <hi>for that purpoſe is,</hi> The Mayor and Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or one of them. <hi>So that a Seſſions may be held without the Mayor; yet I would never do it if I could prevail with the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to joyn with us, as we earneſtly endeavour'd time after time to do in the Caſe before you, for the chuſing of an Alderman, but he utterly refus'd us, at four ſeveral times, at ſome good diſtance of time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If it be ſaid, That the power to elect an Alderman is given to the Mayor and Aldermen, or the major part of them; and</hi> ſo the Mayor by himſelf is particularly and expreſly named <hi>by the Name of his Office; and therefore is of the</hi> Quorum <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other expreſs making of a</hi> Quorum.</p>
               <p>Reſp. This I have already ſpoken to, (viz.) <hi>upon what account he is ſo named, and it could not be otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that this does not ſo make him of the</hi> Quorum <hi>in it, is manifeſt by this, that</hi> thoſe other Clauſes where there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Quorums <hi>of perſons, tho'</hi> the Mayor be there likewiſe mention'd <hi>in the beginning of the Clauſes, yet</hi> he is repeated over again, <hi>when they come to make him of the</hi> Quorum: <hi>This ſhews the naming him before by his Office did not do it, if it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37883:17"/>did, the naming of him again in the</hi> Quorum, <hi>will be a Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and a vain Repetition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But perhaps it will be ſaid,</hi> It belongs to the Office of a Mayor at the Common Law, <hi>to ſummon the Corporation (and amongſt the reſt the Aldermen) when he ſees there is occaſion, and he muſt as Mayor be preſent among them, or nothing can be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us examine the truth of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe that</hi> advis'd the Indictment were not of this Opinion; <hi>and I heard it was ſaid at the Tryal, that it was drawn with good advice; for the Indictment it ſelf challenges this Right, to the Mayor upon another ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It</hi> would intimate as if the Words of the Charter gave it him, <hi>as I have already obſerv'd; which ſays, that</hi> ſecundum privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia conceſſa eſt: <hi>therefore they thought it was not his due at the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For his Name of Mayor, <hi>that imports no ſuch thing: He is</hi> Major, <hi>that is, the Greater, the more Eminent; this notes his pre-eminence in Reſpect and Reverence, but gives him little more of power than what the reſt of the Aldermen have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The like Office among the old</hi> Romans <hi>was the</hi> Praetor, <hi>which (as</hi> Minſheu <hi>ſays) comes from</hi> prae-itor, a prae-eundo, <hi>he does</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ire, <hi>or</hi> praecedere, <hi>or</hi> praeſidere. <hi>He goes firſt, and ſits uppermoſt, but it gives him no more power. But the Mayor in our Caſe would neither lead nor drive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if there can be no Election of an Alderman without his Summons and Preſence, and if he be wilful (as the Mayor in our Caſe was) he is not only</hi> Major Maximus, <hi>but</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus fac totum <hi>(as the vulgar Saying is) or</hi> Dominus faciens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The twelve Aldermen without him, will be but ſo many</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; <hi>the Mayor will be the</hi> Great Figure, <hi>and the Aldermen will ſignifie only in conjunction with him. We may then ſay of every Alderman, as the one</hi> Grecian <hi>Captain ſaid of the other of</hi> Ulyſſes, Nihil eſt Diomede remoto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Mayor will be that which the Logicians call</hi> Cauſa ſine qua non quae per ſe nihil facit, ſed tantum eſſe aliquid ſine qua Reliquae cauſae non faciunt. <hi>So much for his Name and Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> for the Office it ſelf. <hi>That does not require his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons nor Preſence in all the meetings of the Aldermen; for the Buſineſs of the Corporation, it is not incident nor eſſential to his Office of Mayor by the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:37883:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Common Law looks upon him as the Head or Chief of a Corporation; but he is no Officer of the Common Law, to whom the Common-Law limits or preſcribes any Duty, as it does to a Iudge, a Sheriff, a Conſervator of the Peace, a Coroner or a Conſtable: Theſe are all Officers at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and the Common-Law inſtructs them in their Power and Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Mayor being the Head of a Corporation, and a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration having its eſſence by Charter or Preſcription (which preſuppoſes a Charter) he has no power but what the Charter expreſly gives him. The Common Law takes no farther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us examine</hi> the Ground and Nature of a Corporation, <hi>and there we ſhall find the true Nature and Office of a Mayor, or any other Head, (for 'tis all one.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The true Ground and Original of Corporations in Cities and great Towns, is this: Thoſe are generally the Staples of Trade and Merchandize; and Trade (as is ſaid</hi> in the Caſe of the City of <hi>London,</hi> 8 Co. 125. a.) <hi>cannot be maintain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Order and Government. And therefore the King, for the Publick Good, may exect</hi> Gildam Mercatoriam, <hi>a</hi> Fraternity or Society, <hi>or Incorporation of Merchants,</hi> to the end that good Order and Rule ſhall be by them obſerv'd, <hi>for the Encreaſe and Advancement of Trade and Merchandizing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suppoſe the King ſhould by his Charter Encorporate a Town, by the Name of Mayor and twelve Aldermen, and ſhould not ſet out their Duty and Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What power would the Law give them in that Caſe? They would have no power as Conſervators of the Peace, or as Iuſtices of the Peace: They could neither Fine or Impriſon. If they ſhould take upon them to meddle in theſe matters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſs power given them by the words of the Charter, It would be</hi> Sutor ultra Crepidam.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore Charters uſually add theſe Powers by expreſs Clauſes to thoſe purpoſes, and make the Mayor a Iuſtice of Peace, or a Iudge of Goal-Delivery; but then he acts in thoſe Powers not</hi> Quatenus Major, <hi>nor</hi> eo nomine; <hi>but becauſe of the expreſs power given him, as it might have done to any other Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The uniting the Powers in one perſon, does not confound the ſeveral and different Capacities of that perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Charter gives the only Rule in theſe Caſes, and that a Corporation is a meer Creature of the Charters that does conſtitute it, and gives it it's Being; and therefore the Bounds and Limits of it's working appears, by this.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:37883:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suppoſe that neither this nor any other Charter had given to this Corporation of</hi> Briſtol <hi>any power to chooſe a new Mayor, or new Aldermen upon the Death of the old, they could then have made no new Election, but when the Mayor and Aldermen had died, the Corporation had been diſſolv'd. The Charter that gives them their Being, muſt provide for their Continuance and Succeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus it is held in the Caſe of</hi> the Corporation of <hi>Dungannon</hi> in <hi>
                     <hi>Ireland,</hi> in thoſe Reports that go by the Name of the Lord</hi> Coke<hi>'s</hi> 12 Rep. 120, 121. <hi>So that the Charter muſt provide for an Election in order to a Succeſſion, or otherwiſe the Law will not help them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And though the Mayor is the more Eminent and Excellent, and ought to have greater reſpect and reverence, yet</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter <hi>that we are upon is to be conſider'd in the nature of it,</hi> viz. The Election of an Alderman. <hi>It is not</hi> a matter of Intereſt, or of Privilege, or of Power, <hi>for then the Mayor ought to be preferr'd in it. But it is matter</hi> of Duty and Labour, and Truſt and Trouble. <hi>It is</hi> Officium, <hi>not</hi> Dominium, <hi>to chooſe an Alderman. It is rather a Burthen than a Power or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; as is ſaid in the Mayor of</hi> Oxford<hi>'s Caſe in</hi> Latches Rep. 231.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But then it will be ask't, that if it depend upon the Charter, and not upon the Common Law,</hi> Who ſhall appoint the time of Election, if the Charter be ſilent in it, as here it ſeems to be? <hi>This will be a great defect, and ſo there will be no meeting, nor no Election, and ſo the Corporation will expire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this I Anſwer, That the Charter does provide for it, for thoſe whoſe Duty it is to make an Election, it is their Duty to agree to meet for that purpoſe, and to appoint the time, or elſe they do not diſcharge their Duty. They break their Oath and are puniſhable for their Omiſſion, and may forfeit their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now I do not deny but it is the Duty of the Mayor, and it is the equal Duty of the Aldermen, to ſee a time be appointed for an Election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as the Mayor is the Chief in pre-eminence, ſo it aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates his neglect if he refuſes it: But his neglect of his Duty will not excuſe the reſt of the Electors for the not doing of their Duty, and the performing of their Qaths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it be ſaid, What if they do not agree upon the time, but are divided?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37883:19"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwer. Whoever can carry an Election when they are met and chuſe ſhall alſo govern in the time of meeting if there be any difference about it; and that is not the Mayor, but the</hi> Major pars eorum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now this agrees with the Rule of the Law in the like Caſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a Commiſſion of the Peace to try Felonies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And to hold a Court of Quarter-Seſſions, Who ſhall iſſue out the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and appoint the Time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Thoſe that conſtitute the Court, and are to Exerciſe the Power, muſt iſſue out the Summons. If twenty Iuſtices of the Peace, not having one of the</hi> Quorum <hi>amongſt them, ſhould iſſue out a Summons for a General Quarter-Seſſions, it would be void; for twenty Iuſtices of the Peace cannot hold ſuch a Seſſions, if there be not one of the</hi> Quorum <hi>among them: Nor can the</hi> Cuſtos Rotulorum <hi>alone do it, though he is commonly moſt Eminent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus is it in the Commiſſion of Gaol-Delivery, and of Dyer and Terminer. We may ſee the Forms of them in</hi> Crompt. Juriſd. of Courts, f. 121, 125. <hi>The expreſs words of their Commiſſion, for appointing time and place,</hi> Ad certum diem quem vos tres vel duo veſtrum (Quorum vos A. B. &amp; C. D. unum eſſe volumus) ad hoc provederitis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore there was no need of any more expreſs Proviſion in the Charter, for a Summons for an Election of an Alderman, or the appointing of a time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the next place, for the</hi> neceſſity of the Mayor's being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>as well as their meeting by his Summons, I ſee no reaſon for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true, there is a Caſe in Print that ſeems to make for it, tho' I never yet heard it ſo much as mention'd, either at the Trial (for I was not there) or throughout the whole Caſe; yet it is fit for me to take notice of it; for I make no doubt but before we have done we ſhall hear of it. It is in Serjeant</hi> Rolls's Abridgment, Part I. Tit. Corporation, f. 513, 514. Caſe 5, 6, 7. <hi>Between</hi> Hicks <hi>and the Borough of</hi> Launceſton <hi>in</hi> Cornwal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved</hi> per Curiam (<hi>which were only two Iudges,</hi> viz. <hi>the Chief Iuſtice</hi> Richardſon <hi>and Iuſtice</hi> Croke, <hi>no other of the Iudges being there.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That if a Corporation conſiſts of a Mayor and eight Aldermen, with a Clauſe in the Patent, That if any of the Aldermen dye, that then the Mayor and the reſt of the Aldermen within eight days after ſhall Elect another; though it be not limited, that they or the greater number of them may elect, yet the greater number of them may elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37883:19"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if the Mayor, at the time of the death of an Alderman, be abſent at</hi> London <hi>till after the eight days; and the reſt of the Aldermen within eight days, come to the Deputy Mayor and require him to make an Aſſembly of them, to elect another within the eight days, and he refuſe; and upon that the greater number of the Aldermen meet without the Mayor or his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, and Elect an Alderman; that it is a void Election,</hi> for the Mayor ought to be preſent at it, by the Words of the Grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſeems to be a ſtronger Caſe than ours, for there is a certain time limited, by which they muſt make their Election,</hi> viz. <hi>eight days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I firſt Obſerve, That this Caſe (as far as I can find) was not a Caſe depending by any Suit or Action; for in that Caſe it is ſaid,</hi> That a Writ was granted to make a new Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Alderman. <hi>So that I ſuppoſe it was upon a Motion only: I have a Copy of the Rules which ſhews it to be ſo (as I take it.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then it does not appear to be upon an Argument, for had it beén ſo, two Iudges (I preſume) would not have determin'd it, but have put it off till the Court had been full (as uſually they do) therefore it was not ſo ſolemn, nor has not ſo great Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But take it as it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The time of eight days being limited, by which the Election was to be made, makes the Caſe never a whit the ſtronger; for there the Iudges declare, that there may be an Election after the eight days, and the limiting that time was to quicken them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then obſerve the ground thoſe two Iudges went upon, they</hi> do not ſay it ought to be ſo at the Common Law, <hi>as doubtleſs they would, had they thought that the Common Law would have ruled it; for if the Common Law ſerves for it, it was idle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to any other ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Iudges in the Caſe of</hi> Launceſton <hi>ſay, that the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or muſt be preſent at the Election,</hi> by the Words of the Grant. <hi>So that they went by that Rule which I have urged, which is the words of the Grant: 'tis the Charter only muſt give the Rule, as I have Argued all this while.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now what the words of the Charter were, in the Caſe of</hi> Launceſton, <hi>does not appear in the Report of that Caſe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there was an expreſs Proviſion in the Charter, requiring the meeting of the Aldermen by the Summons of the Mayor, and in his preſence, which if ſo, then there is no diſputing againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:37883:20"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the drawer of the Indictment againſt us, has ſo drawn it, as if the Charter in our Caſe did ſo require it too. But there is nothing to that purpoſe; nay, as I have obſerv'd, there are concomitant Clauſes that give another conſtruction, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue to the contrary. Therefore the Caſe of</hi> Launceſton <hi>differs from ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is another thing wherein the Caſe of</hi> Launceſton <hi>and ours differs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am no Enemy to the Government I Live under; if any man think otherwiſe of me, I care not, becauſe I cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern another Man's Thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do agree that this Sovereign Court of the</hi> King's Bench, <hi>as is reſolv'd in</hi> James Bagg<hi>'s Caſe, hath a ſuper-intendency, and a ſpecial Authority in Caſes of this nature, which more concern matter of Government and the publick Peace and Order, than any Man's private Right or Property.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in ſuch Caſes this Court governs it ſelf much by the Circumſtances of the Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now let us mind the Circumſtances of the Caſe Reported by Serjeant</hi> Rolls, <hi>and of our Caſe, and let them be compar'd, and there will be a very wide difference between them. And therein I dare appeal to any rational unbiaſs'd Man in the World, for the Innocency of our proceedings in the whole matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Mayor in the Caſe of</hi> Launceſton, <hi>happen'd to be in</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>at the death of the Alderman (to ſupply whoſe place there needed the Election.) He was not in the Town that was to chuſe, whereof he was Mayor when the Election was made.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Aldermen were under an apprehenſion that they ſhould be guilty of a great omiſſion and neglect of their Duty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had ſome thought of their being under an Oath too, and that they might be liable to puniſhment if they did not chuſe within the eight days preſcrib'd by their Charter; nay, 'tis likely they thought they could make no choice at all if they did it not within the eight days: Tho' all this was but their miſtake of the Law, yet it was very pardonable in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Iudges in their Reſolution upon that Caſe, rectifie that Miſtake, and a new Election is thereupon order'd by this Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Mayor there was not wilfully abſent, for he was at</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>when the Alderman died: he was at a very great diſtance from his Town too</hi> viz. Launceſton, <hi>about</hi> 200 <hi>miles, as I take it; ſo that he could hardly hear of the death of the Alderman in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37883:20"/>the eight days time, and go down thither before the end of the eight days, there was no great neceſſity of an Election ſo ſoon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Aldermen had done what they did out of a zeal for the Publick; though it were a zeal without knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I do not find that the void Election and the Aldermens meeting about it was held a Ryot or an unlawful Aſſembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No, they were not ſo much as blam'd for what they did; nay, ſure they were rather to be commended for their juſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But our Caſe was quite another thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all our Circumſtances, and the very plain words of our Charter that appoints the manner of our Election, we had, to our great charge, and upon good advice, drawn up in a ſpecial Plea; (for the Queſtion truly ariſes upon the words of the Charter, and the conſtruction of them.) How it happen'd I cannot tell, but a Iudge ruled us to plead not Guilty; our chargeable ſpecial Plea came in a little too late.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was a matter of Record, and of Law, and fitter to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the Iudges than by a Iury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But theſe in truth were our Circumſtances, as I ſhall briefly relate them, and I am ready to make out the truth of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Alderman of</hi> Briſtol <hi>tho' choſen, yet cannot officiate till he be ſworn; he cannot be ſworn (by the expreſs words of the Charter) but before the Mayor and Recorder both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I being the Recorder of</hi> Briſtol, <hi>happenn'd to be there ſome time before the day of chuſing Members to the</hi> Oxford <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not long after Sir</hi> John Lloid's <hi>death: I was indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Richard Hart <hi>the then Mayor, and all of us (I think not one Alderman abſent) were then met in the Council Chamber, the uſual place for that purpoſe: we had nothing elſe to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was mov'd that we might then make choice of a new Alderman, while not only Mr. Mayor was preſent, but while the Recorder was there too: So that the Party choſen might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly have been ſworn and enter'd upon his charge; for they have their diſtinct Wards: And the Recorder many times comes not thither in a year or two; for I live forty Miles from them, and I ſeldom tarry above two nights at a Gaol-Delivery; but then (as it fell out) I was there upon another occaſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None oppos'd it but Mr. Mayor, and he did it upon a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Complement, as he pretended, becauſe Sir</hi> John Lloid, <hi>(as he ſaid) was not yet buried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of reſpect to Mr. Mayor, we did forbear.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:37883:21"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some good time after, and after Sir</hi> John Lloid <hi>had been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, I happen'd unexpectedly to be there again; and Mr. Mayor was earneſtly preſs'd again then to go to an Election upon the former reaſon, that the new Alderman might preſently be ſworn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Mayor ſtill refus'd; I do not remember but all the reſt were very willing to have gone to an Election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We did the ſecond time forbear, tho' I think we were all there (I am ſure a great number.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I tarried then four or five days, it was at the Election to Parliament, the Poll laſted ſix days; but I left them at the Poll, I was not fond of being choſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Evening (as I take it) before I went away, we were again upon the place, and the Mayor with us, and he was again preſs'd to it, but wilfully went away, and we ſtill forbore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that night ſome of us ſign'd a Writing, deſiring Mr. Mayor to joyn with us, and we declar'd in it, if he did not joyn, we would proceed without him, being the</hi> major pars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſhews we had no deſign to chuſe in his abſence; nay, it plainly appear'd, that the deſign was on the Mayor's part; for he knew I could not ſtay, and he was deſirous to chuſe in the abſence of ſome of us, that he might carry the Election againſt the perſon next in courſe to be choſen, and every way qualified</hi> (viz.) (<hi>Alderman</hi> Day.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I conſulted the Charter, and found it as I have now obſerv'd upon it, and was clearly of Opinion, for the Reaſons I have offer'd, that in ſuch Circumſtances the major part might chuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We gave notice to the Mayor and all the Aldermen then in Town, and tho' the Government is moſt miſerably divided, yet in this Buſineſs there was nothing of Faction, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parties were not engag'd; only the Mayor had his Deſign. For we were ſix Aldermen at the Choice: Sir</hi> Robert Cann, <hi>an intimate Friend of the Mayor's being lame of the Gout, ſent us an Excuſe, but would approve of our Choice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another of our number, one of our ſix, is a zealous Man of Mr. Mayor's way; yet not taking that to be now concern'd, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with us, and voted the ſame way. We were ſix, and this appears by the Indictment, and we were unanimous in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we choſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No other perſon was ſo much as nam'd, nor I believe thought on by any Body, unleſs by Mr. Mayor; there were but four Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen more in being, for Mr. Mayor was none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the perſon choſen was not only next in courſe, but every way qualifi'd; has a great Eſtate (worth three or four of ſome of the Aldermen) no Tang of a Fanatick, a conſtant Churchman,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37883:21"/>he had but one great Fault; he gave his Vote at the Election to Parliament for my ſelf and Sir</hi> John Knight, <hi>againſt Mr. May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and Sir</hi> Tho. Earl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The perſon is not ſworn to this day, nor does deſire the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but rather declines it, being fit for it: He ſhould have been Mayor this Year in courſe, but is put by it, and he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There has been another ſince choſen in his place, by the Votes of five only, (Sir</hi> Richard Hart <hi>the Mayor being one.) I am ſure they are not</hi> major pars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for this choice by ſix, who are Iuſtices of the Peace as well as Mr. Mayor, and the other four, we who are four of ſix, are all Indicted for a Ryot upon the account of this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this Indictment is found before Mr. Mayor our Fellow Iuſtice, and four more at the moſt; ſo that five, who are the leſſer number, exerciſe their Authority over thoſe that were ſix in number when they acted, which fix were as much Iuſtices of the Peace as they five.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is obſervable, that tho' we were ſix of us, and all unanimous in our Election, yet they have politickly Indicted but four of us, and left two out, becauſe it would have been too groſs and palpable, if ſix Iuſtices of Peace ſhould have been indicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a leſſer number of their Brother Iuſtices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But had they Indicted all ſix, it would then plainly have appear'd too that the choice had been made by the greater part, which they wiſely thought to conceal; but yet it does appear in their very Indictment (though darkly couch'd in it,) for it ſays that we four being Recorder and Aldermen,</hi> Cum aliis Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannis, <hi>did chuſe the Alderman; that word</hi> (Aldermannis) <hi>being in the Plural Number, muſt be two more at leaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it ſhall be adjudg'd that we cannot chuſe an Alderman, but by the Mayor's Summons, and in his preſence, theſe Miſchiefs will follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> he will wholly govern and diſpoſe of Elections at his ſingle will and pleaſure; <hi>for he that can order the time as he pleaſes, and forbear to ſummon the Electors till he ſees his own opportunity and advantage, tho' often deſired to go on upon it, and refuſes to do it time after time, till ſuch as will not comply with him be out of the way (as the Recorder is very ſeldom there, and tarries but a night or two, and then is in a hurry of Buſineſs, and moſt of the Aldermen are often at their Country Houſes) the Mayor will caſt the choice upon whom he thinks fit, as in this caſe he has done. This Mayor and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37883:22"/>four Aldermen have rejected the choice made by ſix, and of the perſon that was next in courſe, and every way qualified: And yet the Charter thought not fit to truſt any fewer than the Mayor and the whole Bench of Aldermen, in a matter of this importance to the City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it be ſaid, That in caſe the Mayor unreaſonably defer it, we may complain to this Court,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> King's-Bench, <hi>and have a</hi> Mandamus, <hi>or apply our ſelves to the King and Councel to compel him to proceed to an Election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who will be at ſo great a charge and trouble? And that courſe is not ſo ſpeedy, it may chance to be in a Vacation; but let it be as ſpeedy as can be, the Mayor in the mean time has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd his Ends, and gain'd his Opportunity, and done his Work, as the Mayor in our Caſe did; where the Mayor and four more (but five in all) being</hi> minor pars, <hi>have controll'd the choice made by the</hi> major pars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it ſhall be ſaid, That if the</hi> major pars <hi>be preſent, and join in Voting to an Election, tho' they divide in the perſon, yet the</hi> major pars <hi>ſo met ſhall make a good Election, and in Law it ſhall be the choice of all preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That I muſt deny, for the words of the Charter are, That the</hi> major pars ſuperviventium, <hi>ſhall make the choice, that is, as I underſtand it, agree in their Votes or Voices in the Party choſen, and ſo it was in the choice that we ſix made. This agrees with the Rules of the Common Law, in Elections and Leaſes to be made by Corporations.</hi> Dyer 247. plac. 74. <hi>and Sir</hi> John Davies Rep. 47. <hi>And this agrees with the Statute of</hi> 33 H. 8. cap. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if this ſhould not be Law (as I take it is) yet the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Election of an Alderman, made by the Mayor and four Aldermen more, cannot be good; for though the Mayor and ſeven Aldermen were preſent at it, yet three of them did not join in going then to an Election; for they had join'd with us before in our choice, and therefore oppos'd any after Election to be made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they have gotten a conceit among them at</hi> Briſtol, <hi>that what is done in a Man's preſence, where his preſence is requir'd by their Charter, tho he diſſent and oppoſe what is done, is yet legally done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As in the Caſe of the Swearing of an Alderman, by the expreſs words of the Charter it cannot be done but before the Mayor and Recorder both. This Sir</hi> Richard Hart <hi>was duly choſen an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman long ago, but not ſworn until the laſt Gaol-Delivery when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37883:22"/>we were going to Try the Felons. I being preſent, they thought that ſufficient to ſatisfie the Charter, and in a Tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with an hideous noiſe, they cryed out to ſwear him, and this was not the uſual place neither for it. I oppos'd the Swearing of him, and I will juſtifie it, that he was utterly unfit to be Sworn, by ſomething that happenn'd ſince his being Elected an Alderman; they would not hear me, but reſolv'd to proceed to ſwear him, becauſe I was preſent with the Mayor. Thereupon I withdrew, and in my abſence they went on to ſwear him, and he now acts as an Alderman, and as a Iuſtice of Peace, under this colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If no Election of an Alderman can be made but in the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's preſence,</hi> it will be in the power of one ſingle perſon (if he be obſtinate and wilful) to forfeit the Charter. <hi>For if he find the Aldermen like to chuſe contrary to his mind, he need but with draw, and all the reſt are inſignificant perſons, and ſo there ſhall be no Election in any reaſonable time, and thereby the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties forfeited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this abſolute power allow'd to Mayors</hi> may ſerve a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Turn for once, <hi>it may do as much Miſchief another time; for he may be of a contrary and croſs humour to what may be deſir'd. And he is not a perſon nominated by any ſuperiour power to that place, or impos'd upon the Corporation, but cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from amongſt themſelves, and choſen by themſelves: But tho' they chuſe him, yet it is not ſafe to truſt all the Liberties of the City in the Breaſt of one Man; for one man may eaſily change and be wrought upon, where many cannot. It is better to truſt twelve than one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Right of Election is a very tender thing, <hi>and it is a Maxim at the Common Law, and ſtrengthned by ſeveral Acts of Parliament,</hi> That Elections ſhould be free.</p>
               <p>By the Stat. of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> the 1ſt. in the time of that Wiſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent King <hi>Edward</hi> the I. <hi>It is Enacted,</hi> That Elections be free. <hi>And it forbids</hi> under a grievous Penalty <hi>(thoſe are the words) that</hi> nul haut home, <hi>no great Man (ſuch as every Mayor is in his ſphere) ſhall diſturb to make free Election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Edward Coke <hi>in his</hi> 2 Inſt. f. 169. <hi>in his Expoſition of that Statute, ſays it extends to all ſorts of Elections, and agreés with the Maxim of the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if the Mayor ſhall at three ſeveral times refuſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and deſire of the Aldermen, and knowing that they can make no choice without him, refuſe to join with them till he ſees his own time and advantage, he will have his own choice, do what they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37883:23"/>can; for before they can complain of him (which is a work of time and charge, and trouble) he will have done his work, and ſo prevent them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then where is the freedom of Election?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This could never appear more plainly than in this Caſe of ours, where</hi> the Election by the majority is ſet aſide, <hi>and the choice made by a leſſer number, and in effect by Mr. Mayor only, is that which carries it. It plainly appears that we had no ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter deſign to do any thing without the Mayor, for we did all we could to get him to join with us, and he thrice denied us; but it as plainly appears that the Mayor had a deſign in refuſing to do it till ſome of us muſt be gone, and then to ſteal an Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on behind our backs, by a leſſer number, when he had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After all that I have ſaid I do agree, that had eleven Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of us gone about an Election without ſo much as deſiring the Mayor to join with us, or it may be upon once or twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuſed; or when the Mayor had been occaſionally abſent; or had it any way appeared that we meant a ſurpriſe in it; or had we made a Choice, ſubject to the leaſt Exception, and had he not obſtinately gone away from us, being in perſon upon the place, without ſo much as giving us the leaſt reaſon for his refuſal, I ſhould have held my tongue and not have concern'd my ſelf any farther in it. I hope it ſufficiently appears, that I have been no Enemy to Government and Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to chooſe an Alderman was our Duty, and we were under an Oath to do our Duty, and we did but diſcharge our Truſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I may (I think) ſave my ſelf the labour of arguing, that however, if we were miſtaken in the Conſtruction of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the point of Law in the making of our Election, yet here is</hi> no Riot <hi>in the Caſe (for we are indicted for a Riot) for a Riot is the doing of an unlawful act</hi> with force and violence; <hi>neither are we an unlawful Aſſembly, for that is, where there is an intent to do an unlawful Act, but ſtill</hi> with force and violence, <hi>but they go away without doing it, as appears by</hi> Poulton de Pace Reg. &amp; Regin. fol. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in caſe the Election we made be adjudged duly made, then the pretence of a Riot vaniſhes of it ſelf, as is held in</hi> Eden's Caſe, Cro. Eliz. 697. <hi>If the Indictment be void for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal matter, which in the Caſe there, was an unlawful Entry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Statute of</hi> 8 H. 6. <hi>where that Statute was miſ-recited, they were not allowed in that caſe to ſtand upon the Riot.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I have but a ſhort word more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have been the Recorder of</hi> Briſtol <hi>theſe one and twenty years, longer I think than any Man can be remembred. I have ſworn all the Aldermen that are now upon the Bench, in my time, and many more who are now dead. I can ſay it without vanity, till the time of this unhappy Election of Members to the</hi> Oxford <hi>Parliament (which I ſought not) I had the good Will of all ſides, even of this Mr. Mayor, who was, Sir</hi> Richard Hart; <hi>for I never would join with any Party, but did all I could, when I came amongſt them, to join them together and unite them: For ever ſince they grew rich and full of Trade and Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, too much Sail and too little Ballaſt, they have been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably divided.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Afterwards my Lord</hi> Grandiſon <hi>brought a Prohibition ſuggeſting that the Court had granted Adminiſtration upon a ſurpriſe, and being Grandfather to the Children, and ſo nearer of kinred, prayed that Adminiſtration might be committed to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lady replyed, that it was obtained after great delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without any ſurprize; and upon a Demurrer the Queſtion was, Whether this Adminiſtration was well granted to the Lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued now by Dr.</hi> Maſter <hi>for the Plaintiff, and afterwards by a Common Lawyer on the ſame ſide, in</hi> Hillary-<hi>Term following. And by Dr.</hi> Reines, <hi>and Sir</hi> William Williams <hi>for the Defendant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Civilian argued, That the Father of both the Children, died inteſtate, and that their Mother adminiſtred, and afterwards
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37883:24"/>made a Will, of which ſhe appointed my Lord to be Executor, and thereby committed the Infant to his Cuſtody; which being in Fact true, the Curatorſhip of the Living Child, by the Civil Law, draws to it the Adminiſtration of the Eſtate of the dead Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a</hi> Statute Law which empowers the Father by Deed or Will to diſpoſe the cuſtody of his Child under Age,
<note place="margin">12 Car. 2. cap. 24.</note> to any in Poſſeſſion or Remainder, who may take the Profits of his Lands, and poſſeſs himſelf of the ſaid Infant's perſonal Eſtate, and bring Actions in relation thereunto, as a Guardian in Socage might have done. <hi>And wherever a Father or</hi>

                  <hi>Mother has made ſuch a diſpoſition, a Iudge cannot aſſign a Guardian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Spiritual Courts have power to repeal this Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion granted to my Lady</hi> Dover; <hi>the Right is not in queſtion, for whoever has it reaps no advantage, becauſe 'tis for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Infant; the conteſt is, who ought to be admitted by the Spiritual Court to Adminiſter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be denied but that the Great Grandmother is a degree more remote than the Grandfather: If therefore that Court hath entruſted one who ought not to have Adminiſtration, they have an undoubted power in ſuch caſe to make an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If my Lord had been Adminiſtrator, it had been agreeable to the Common-Law, for he is Guardian in Socage</hi> durante mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore aetate.</p>
               <p>E contra.
<note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
                  <hi>It was ſaid, That my Lord was really indebted to the Eſtate of the Infant inteſtate, and therefore as this Caſe is, the Spiritual Court ought not to repeal the Adminiſtration once granted, for 'tis for the benefit of the Infant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis not material who ſhall be Adminiſtrator, for he who is ſo</hi> durante minore aetate, <hi>hath no power over the Eſtate; he is only a</hi> Curator <hi>in the Civil Law, which is in the nature of a Bayliff in our Law, who hath only power to ſell</hi> bona peritura.</p>
               <p>Probate of Wills <hi>did not Originally belong to the Spiritual Courts</hi> de jure, <hi>they had that Authority</hi> per conſenſum Regis &amp; Magnatum: <hi>And as thoſe Courts had not original Iuriſdiction in ſuch Caſes, ſo they had no power to grant Adminiſtration, 'till enabled by the Statute of</hi> Edw.
<note place="margin">31 Ed. 3. cap. 11.</note> 3. <hi>For before that time the Kings of</hi> England <hi>by their proper Officers</hi> ſolebant capere bona inteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum in manus ſuas.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis plain that the Ordinary had no power by the Common Law over an Inteſtate's Eſtate, for he could not maintain an Action to recover any part of it: now if the Law had given him a power over the Goods; it would likewiſe have given him an Authority or Remedy to recover them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Action would have lain againſt him at the Common Law,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The word</hi> Papiſt <hi>is not defin'd either by the Common Law, or the Statutes of this Realm; for from the firſt of the Queen to the</hi> 25 Car. 2. <hi>it is not to be found what a</hi> Papiſt <hi>is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are ſeveral Statutes between thoſe times which provide againſt the Iurisdiction of the</hi> Pope, <hi>and which inflict particular Puniſhments upon committing Offences therein prohibited, but none of thoſe Laws give any definition of a</hi> Papiſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If by a</hi> Papiſt <hi>is meant him who embraces the Doctrine of the</hi> Pope; <hi>it was puniſhable before the Reformation to be of a contrary Opinion: Now in the vulgar acceptation of the word, a man may hold the ſame Opinion with the</hi> Church of <hi>

                  <hi>an Action on the Caſe was brought in the</hi> Common-Pleas, <hi>for calling of the Plaintiff</hi> Heretick, <hi>and</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby <hi>the King's Serjeant argued, That the Action would not lye, becauſe the word did import a Spiritual Matter, of which the Temporal Courts had no knowledge; and of that Opinion were the</hi> Chief Juſtice <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> and Juſtice <hi>
                     <hi>Shelley:</hi> The ſame may be ſaid in this Caſe, that the word</hi> Papiſt <hi>relates to ſomething which is Spiritual, of which this Court hath no cognizance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Words which are actionable muſt immediately</hi> injure <hi>the perſon of whom they are ſpoken, either in his</hi> Profeſſion, <hi>or bring him in danger of ſome</hi> Puniſhment,
<note place="margin">Hob. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>as to call an</hi> (Attorney Bribing Knave, <hi>which are adjectively ſpoken, yet 'tis an Injury done to him in his</hi> Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was ſaid at the Trial in the</hi> Common-Pleas, <hi>That 'tis acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to call a Man</hi> Papiſt <hi>at this time, though it might not be ſo at another time. This ſeems to be a very vain aſſertion, for though the Times may alter, the Law is ſtill the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It would be a very great inconvenience, if Men ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd by Actions to call another Man a</hi> Papiſt, <hi>for this would be an encouragement to</hi> Popery, <hi>and a check upon the</hi> Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>to puniſh the Profeſſors thereof, for ſaying a Man is a</hi> Papiſt, <hi>who is really ſo both in his Iudgment and Profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But admitting the word to be actionable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Not actiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to call a man Papiſt. Cro. Eliz. 191.</note> 
                  <hi>'tis not ſo before Conviction, for 'tis very improperly uſed, and of no ſignification or diſcredit before that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe words are not actionable as coupled with his Offices, becauſe he hath alledged no particular damage or Loſs, and his Offices are only Honorary, and of no Profit, and therefore he could receive no Damage by ſpeaking theſe words, if true, when they in no ſort relate to his Offices, and are too remote to be applied to them.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
                  <hi>The words are actionable in themſelves, for they ſcandalize the Plaintiff in his Reputation, and may be a means to bring him to corporal Puniſhment; for by ſeveral Acts of Parliament many Puniſhments are inflicted upon</hi> Popiſh Recuſants, <hi>which is the ſame thing with a</hi> Papiſt; <hi>they are diſabled from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Office or Imployment in the Kingdom, they are not to come into the Kings preſence, or within five Miles of the City of</hi> London, <hi>and the calling of him</hi> Papiſt <hi>ſubjects him to the danger of being Indicted for a Traytor, for the words are</hi> Synonimous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> H. 8. <hi>took upon him the Supremacy which the</hi> Pope <hi>had unlawfully Vſurped, there were certain</hi> Papiſts <hi>in thoſe days who called themſelves</hi> Roman Catholicks, <hi>that they might be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe who bore Allegiance to their lawful King; which general appellation was afterwards changed into the word</hi> Papiſt, <hi>ſo that both ſignifie the ſame thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Objection that tho Times change, the Law is ſtill the ſame, may receive this Anſwer, That when the force of words is changed with the Times, thoſe words ſhall be actionable now, which were not ſo at another time. As for Example: the proper and genuine ſignification of the word</hi> Knave <hi>is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but now the Times have altered the ſenſe of that word, and made it to be a term of Reproach; ſo that 'tis actionable to call an Attorny</hi> Knave, <hi>who is but a Servant to his Client.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Then as to the Objection that the word</hi> Papiſt <hi>is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd in our Law. There is a Statute which diſables a Man from having any Office whatſoever who ſhall affirm the King to be a</hi> Papiſt,
<note place="margin">13 Car. 2. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that is, a perſon who endeavours to introduce</hi> Popery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>But if the word</hi> Papiſt <hi>is not actionable of it ſelf, yet as coupled with his Offices 'tis otherwiſe, and the Plaintiff may well maintain this Action. And of that Opinion was all the Court: So the Iudgment was affirmed.</hi>

                  <hi>for Lands in the County of</hi> Waterford; <hi>the Caſe upon the ſpecial Verdict was this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>John Fitzgerald <hi>was ſeized in Fee of the Lands in queſtion, who had Iſſue</hi> Katherine <hi>his only Daughter: He by</hi> Leaſe and Releaſe <hi>made a Settlement of thoſe Lands upon the Earl of</hi> Oſſory <hi>and other Truſtees therein named, and their Heirs, to the uſe of himſelf for Life, and after his Deceaſe to the uſe of

               <p>John Fitzgerald <hi>died, his Daughter being then but two years old. She afterwards at the Age of fourteen had</hi> Notice <hi>of this Settlement, but not by the Direction of the Truſtees. That on the</hi> 20th <hi>of</hi> March, <hi>in the</hi> 16th <hi>year of her Age,</hi> ſhe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the Plaintiff, <hi>Edward Villiers</hi> Eſq; without the conſent of the Truſtees, or the major part of them; <hi>and that her Husband</hi> Mr. <hi>Villiers</hi> did not take upon him the Name of <hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Queſtions were, Whether the Eſtate limited to</hi> Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine <hi>be forfeited, without Notice given to her of the Settlement, by the Truſtees themſelves?</hi>

                  <hi>And it was argued, That the Eſtate Tail was determined.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And firſt as to the point of Notice; 'tis not neceſſary to be given to the Daughter, becauſe the Father had not made it in the Settlement. He might diſpoſe of his Eſtate at his pleaſure, and having made particular Limitations of it, there is no room now for the Law to interpoſe, to ſupply the defect of Notice in the Deed. And to this purpoſe the Mayor of</hi> London<hi>'s Caſe was cited, which was, That</hi>

                  <hi>The third Reſolution in</hi> Frances <hi>Caſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8 Co.</note> 
                  <hi>comes neareſt to this now in queſtion, it was</hi> in Replevin, <hi>the Defendant avowed the taking</hi> Damage Feſant. <hi>The Plaintiff pleaded in Barr to the Avowry, that</hi> R. Frances <hi>was ſeized in Fee of the place where,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and deviſed it to</hi> John <hi>(who was his eldeſt Son) for ſixty years, if he ſo long lived, Remainder to</hi> Thomas <hi>for Life, and that</hi> John <hi>made a Leaſe to the Plaintiff for a year. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant replied, that after the Deviſe</hi> R. Frances <hi>made a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Fee of the ſame Lands amongſt others, to the uſe of himſelf for Life. Then as to the other Lands to divers Vſes contained in the Deed; but as to thoſe Lands in which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs was taken, to the ſame Vſes as in the Will, in which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance there was this Priviſo,</hi> That if <hi>John</hi> ſhould diſturb his Executors in the quiet Enjoyment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if he ſhall not ſuffer them to carry away the Goods in his Houſe, then the Uſes limited to him ſhould be void: <hi>He did hinder the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to carry away the Goods, yet it was adjudged that he ſhould keep his Eſtate, becauſe being a Stranger to the Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſhall not loſe it without notice of the Proviſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in anſwer to that Caſe, notice was not the principal matter of that Iudgment, it turned upon a point in Pleading, for the Avowant had not ſhewed any ſpecial act of diſturbance, and a bare denial without doing any more was held to be no breach of the Condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some other Authorities may be cited to prove notice neceſſary,</hi>

                     <hi>Green's</hi> Caſe, 6 Co. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>as where Tenant for Life of a Mannor to which an Advowſon was appendant did in the year</hi> 1594. <hi>preſent</hi> Durſton, <hi>who neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to read the Articles was deprived nine years afterwards by the Ordinary at the Suit of the Patron who preſented him, who alſo dyed two years after the Deprivation; then the Queen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Lapſe, whoſe Preſentee was inducted, and ſix years afterwards</hi> Durſton <hi>dyed, after whoſe death he in Remainder preſented</hi> Green; <hi>now though the Patron was a Party to the Suit of Deprivation, and thereby had ſufficient notice that the Church was vacant, yet it was adjudged that a Lapſe ſhould not incurr but only after notice given by the Ordinary himſelf, and not by any other perſon whatſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this Caſe may receive this Anſwer,</hi> viz. <hi>That notice had not been neceſſary at Law, but it was provided by a particular Act of Parliament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13 Eliz. ca. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that no Title by Lapſe ſhall accrue upon any deprivation, but after ſix months notice thereof given by the Ordinary himſelf to the Patron.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:37883:28"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true the Law is very tender in diveſting the Rights of the Subject; but where an Eſtate is created by the Act of the Party, and reſtrained by particular limitations without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of notice, there the Law will not add notice and make it neceſſary, becauſe the perſon who made ſuch a diſpoſition of his Eſtate might have given it upon what conditions he pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore it may ſeem hard that this Eſtate ſhould be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the neglect or omiſſion of the Truſtees to give notice of this Proviſo; but 'tis apparent that it was the intent of the Father it ſhould be ſo; for by this Limitation the Eſtate is bound in the Hands of an Infant; the reaſon is, becauſe there is a Privity between an Heir and an Anceſtor, and therefore the Heir is bound to take notice of ſuch Conditions which his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor hath impoſed on the Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This Eſtate is determined by the Marriage of the Daughter with Mr.</hi> Villiers, <hi>becauſe there is an expreſs Limitation in the Deed, for that very purpoſe ſhe is enjoyned to marry a</hi> Fitzge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, <hi>or one who ſhould take upon him that name, which is ſtill more extenſive, and ſhe having neglected to do the one, and her Husband having refuſed to do the other, the Aunt in Remainder ſhall take advantage of this Non-performance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And 'tis this Remainder over which makes it a Limitation;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Ventr. 202. Owen 112. Goldsb. 152. Lit. Sect. 723.</note> 
                  <hi>for if it had been a Condition then the intent of the Father had been utterly defeated; for none but the Heir at Law can enter for the breach of a Condition, and ſuch was</hi> Katharine <hi>in this Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Proviſo in this Deed depends upon another Sentence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately going before,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Co. 70.</note> 
                  <hi>to which it hath reference, and then by the expreſs reſolution in</hi> Cromwel's Caſe <hi>'tis a Limitation or Qualification of the Eſtate, and not a Condition, which Eſtate is now determined without Entry or Claim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued that in this Caſe three things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">E contra.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Nature of the Proviſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Notice is abſolutely neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Notice given was not ſufficient, being not ſuch as is required by Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the</hi> 1ſt. <hi>The very nature of this Proviſo is condemned by the Civil Law, and becauſe it works the deſtruction of Eſtates it hath never been favoured at the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All Conditions to reſtrain Marriage generally are held void by both Laws, ſo likewiſe are ſuch which reſtrain people from marrying without the conſent of particular perſons; becauſe they may impoſe ſuch hard terms before they give their conſent, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37883:28"/>may hinder the Marriage it ſelf, and therefore a bare requeſt of ſuch, without their ſubſequent aſſent, has been always allowed to preſerve the Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And which was the principal Point, Notice in this Caſe is abſolutely neceſſary both by the intent of the Father, and by the conſtruction of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are three things of which the Law makes an equal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,</hi> viz. Uſes, Wills <hi>and</hi> Acts of Parliament, <hi>in which, if the intention of the Parties and of the Law makers can be diſcerned, the Caſes which ſeverally fall under the direction of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be governed by the intention without reſpect to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing words, nay ſometimes the Law will ſupply the defect of words themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Books are full of Authorites, where Conſtructions have been made of Acts of Parliament according to the intent of the Makers, and not according to the Letter of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As in</hi> Eyſton <hi>and</hi> Stud's Caſe <hi>in the</hi> Commentaries,
<note place="margin">Plowd. Com. 2 pt. 463.</note> 
                  <hi>where the Husband and Wife levyed a Fine of the Lands of the Wife, and declared the Vſes to their Heirs in Tail, the Remainder to the Heirs of the Wife, they had Iſſue, and the Husband died; the Widow married a ſecond Husband, and he and his Wife join in a ſecond Fine, and declared the Vſes thereof to themſelves for Life, the Remainder to the Husband and his Heirs for ſixty years, the Remainder in Tail to their Iſſue, the Remainder to the Heirs of the Wife; the Iſſue of the firſt Husband entred ſuppoſing the Eſtate had been forfeited by the Statute of</hi> H. 7.
<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>which Enacts,</hi> That if a Woman hath an Eſtate in Dower or in Tail jointly with her Husband, or to her ſelf of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance or Purchaſe of him, and ſhe doth either ſole or with another Husband diſcontinue, it ſhall be void, and he in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder may enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now this Caſe was directly within the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for the</hi> Woman had an Eſtate Tail in poſſeſſion jointly with her firſt Husband <hi>which ſhe had diſcontinued by joining in the Fine with her ſecond Husband; but yet it was adjudged no Forfeiture, becauſe it was not within the intent of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to reſtrain Women to diſpoſe of their own Eſtates, but only ſuch as came from the Husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So here Vſes are in the nature of private Laws, and muſt be governed by the like intention of the Parties; now 'tis not to be ſuppoſed that the Father did intend to disinherit his only Daughter and Heir without notice of this Settlement, therefore though he had not appointed any perſon in particular to give her notice, yet it muſt of neceſſity be preſumed that his intention
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37883:29"/>was, that ſhe ſhould have the Eſtate unleſs ſhe had refuſed upon notice to comply with thoſe Conditions impoſed upon her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the Daughter being Heir at Law and ſo having a good Title by deſcent, if there be any Conveiance made by her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor to defeat that Title, and to which ſhe is a Stranger, ſhe ought by the Rules of Law and Reaſon to have notice of it, and ſo is the expreſs Reſolution in</hi> Frances's Caſe, <hi>where the Deviſe and the Feoffment were both made to the Heir at Law: And the reaſon why in</hi> Fry <hi>and</hi> Porter's Caſe <hi>notice was not held neceſſary was, becauſe the Deviſe was to a Grandaughter, who was not Heir at Law; for the Earl of</hi> Newport <hi>had three Sons then living, and therefore the Parties whom it concerned had the ſame means to inform themſelves upon what Conditions they were to have the Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The notice here given was not ſufficient; for as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary himſelf in</hi> Green's Caſe <hi>ought to have given the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron notice of the Deprivation before a Lapſe ſhould incurr, ſo the Truſtees here ought to give the Daughter notice of this Proviſo before ſhe ſhall loſe her Eſtate for Non-performance of the Conditions on which ſhe ſhould take it, eſpecially ſince the notice ſhe had of this Proviſo was not certain; for 'tis ſaid ſhe had notice not to marry without the conſent of the Truſtees, but 'tis not ſhewed who they are, or how ſhe ſhould apply her ſelf to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides there is ſomething in this Proviſo which the finding in the Verdict will not ſupply, for it may be literally true that the Daughter married without the conſent of the Truſtees, and yet no breach of the Condition, becauſe the Proviſo is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her from marrying without the conſent of them or their Heirs; now it was not found that the Feoffees were then living, and if they were dead their Conſent cannot be required, and ſhe might have the conſent of their Heirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Franklyn, <hi>who was the Husband of</hi> Laetitia <hi>the Aunt in Remainder, hath likewiſe forfeited that Eſtate which he hath, or may have, in right of his Wife (if ſhe had any right) by not taking upon him the name of</hi> Fitzgerald; <hi>for if the Father would have disinherited his Daughter for Non-performance of this Proviſo</hi> a fortiori, <hi>he ſhall be intended to disinherit his Siſter for making fruſtrate his deſire in the ſettlement of his Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> Eaſter-Term <hi>following Iudgment was given, That the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Tail was not determined for want of notice according to the reſolution in</hi> Frances's Caſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the murther of a perſon is rightly expreſſed by</hi> feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous killing, <hi>though not ſo properly as by the word</hi> Murdrum <hi>it ſelf, the omiſſion of which word will not make the Pardon void.</hi>

                  <hi>It was found by Office that a perſon died ſeiſed of two Mannors, and that he held one of the Queen by Knights Service generally, and the other of a Meſne Lord in Chivalry which is the ſame Tenure; now it was held that the firſt general finding ſhall be intended Knights Service</hi> in Capite <hi>becauſe it was moſt for the King's benefit, that he might thereby be entituled to the Wardſhip of the Heir, who was found to be under Age.</hi>

                  <hi>It was argued that ſhe had only an Eſtate for life, becauſe the Words</hi> (All my Eſtate) <hi>cannot be conſtrued to paſs a Fee, for it doth not appear what Eſtate was intended; and Words in a Will, which go to diſinherit an Heir, muſt be plain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant pleaded, that before the ſaid Breach made, he was ſeiſed in Fee of an ancient Mill, and of ſix Acres of Land adjoyning, upon which the ſaid Damm was erected,</hi> time out of mind, <hi>to turn the Water to his ſaid Mill, which Damm was always repaired and maintained by the Defendant, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the ſaid Land; that his Mill was caſually burnt, and he not intending to Re-build it, ſuffered the Damm to be broken down, and converted the Timber to his own uſe, being upon his own Soil,</hi> prout ei bene licuit, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff replied, that by the breaking of the Damm the Water was diverted from his Mill,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant rejoyned, and juſtified his Plea, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed that the Mill of the Plaintiff was an ancient Mill.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi>wherein the Plaintiff ſhewed that he was ſeized of two old and ruinous Fulling Mills, and that</hi> time out of Mind, magna pars aquae cujuſdam rivoli <hi>did run from a certain place to the ſaid Mills; and that</hi> during all that time <hi>there had been a certain Bank to keep the current of the ſaid Water within its bounds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the Plaintiff did pull down thoſe old Mills and erected two new Mills, and the Defendant digged down the Bank,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>tho' there are various ways of declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet they all ſhew that the conſtant courſe was to alledge that the Mills were ancient; for 'tis that which intitles the Party to his Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis for this reaſon alſo, that if two Men have contiguous Houſes, and one ſtops the other's Lights, if they are not</hi> ancient, <hi>an Action will not lye for ſtopping of them up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There may be ſome ſeeming difference between a Right to a Watercourſe, and to Lights in a Window; for no Man can preſcribe to Light</hi> Quatenus <hi>ſuch, becauſe 'tis of common Right to all Men, and cannot be claimed but as affixed to a particular thing or purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Watercourſe may be claimed to ſeveral purpoſes, but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of as univerſal uſe and benefit to Mankind as Light;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37883:37"/>and therefore no particular Man hath a Right to either, but as belonging to an antient Houſe, or ruunning to an ancient Mill, or for ſome other antient Vſe.</hi>

               <p>Anno 15 Car.
<note place="margin">Cro. Car. 575.

And though the Court ſeemed to over-rule that Objection, yet no Iudgment was given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Caſe of</hi> Sly <hi>and</hi> Mordant <hi>was there cited (which is Report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Leon. 247. <hi>id.</hi> 1 Rol.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Plaintiff hath not entituled himſelf to this Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, either by</hi> Preſcription, <hi>or that the Water</hi> debuit vel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuevit currere <hi>to his Mill, for ſo is the Pleading in</hi> Lutterell<hi>'s Caſe, and in all the other Caſes before cited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Therefore the Plea in Bar is good, the Defendant having ſufficiently juſtified his Right, and the Plaintiff having not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to it, here can be no Treſpaſs done, and ſo concluded that Iudgment ought to be reverſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Caſe depends upon the Declaration;</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff hath a good cauſe of Action, for it cannot be denied, but where an injury is done to another, and Damages enſue, 'tis ſufficient to maintain an Action of Treſpaſs, or upon the Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis plain, that an Injury was done to the Plaintiff, and the Damage is as manifeſt, by diverting of the Watercourſe, and the loſs of his Mill; and the Fact is laid to be</hi> injuſte &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litioſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant gives no reaſon why he injured him, but only that he had no uſe of the Water, becauſe his Mill was burnt.</hi>

                  <hi>The Caſe in</hi> Dyer <hi>is a good Authority to ſupport this Action, for 'tis as general as this,</hi> viz. <hi>for diverting a Watercourſe,</hi> per Conſtructionem Waerae, <hi>and doth not ſhew where it was erected, or what Title he had to it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Authorities cited on the other ſide, do rather maintain this way of Pleading, than the contrary, for thoſe Caſes are wherein the Plaintiff declared, that the Water</hi> currere conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit &amp; debuiſſet <hi>to the Plaintiffs Mill, time out of mind,</hi>

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus it was in an Aſſiſe of Nuſance, wherein the Plaintiff ſet forth, that he had a Fountain of Water</hi> currentem uſque ad rotam molendini, &amp;c. <hi>and that the Defendant</hi> divertit curſum aquae <hi>and this was held good.</hi>

                  <hi>The Caſes of ſtopping up of Lights and diverting of Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are not parallel; the Preſcription to Lights muſt be</hi> ratione loci; <hi>and therefore if a Man will erect a new Houſe, and a Stranger will ſtop the Lights; 'tis an injury done, and the Action may be maintained upon the Poſſeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lutterel<hi>'s Caſe was grounded upon the Poſſeſſion; for upon the Plaintiff</hi> Cottell<hi>'s own ſhewing the Preſcription was gone, becauſe he ſet forth, that he had pulled down the old Mills, and

                  <hi>THE Defendant was a Non-conformiſt Miniſter, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for High-Treaſon, in Preaching of theſe words,</hi> viz. Why do the People (<hi>innuendo <hi>the People of</hi>

               <p>We have had two Wicked Kings now together <hi>(innuendo Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Primum, &amp; Carolum Secundum)</hi> who have ſuffered Popery to be introduced under their Noſes, whom I can liken to none but wicked <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and if they <hi>(innuendo, <hi>the People,

                     <hi>(innuendo,</hi> the King and all his Loyal Subjects)</hi> with Rams Horns, broken Pitchers, and a Stone in a Sling, as in the time of old.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, That the Words diſcharged of the</hi> Innuendo's, <hi>if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſeperate, or altogether, have no tendency to Treaſon. The firſt Paragraph doth not import any Crime; and</hi> to ſay that we have had two wicked Kings, <hi>may be a Miſdemeanor, but 'tis not Treaſon, either by intendment of the Death of the King, or by levying War againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Crime ſeems to conſiſt in the next Words, which are</hi> (if they would ſtand to their Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>This ſeems to ſtir up the People to Rebellion, but as they are placed in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will not admit of ſuch a Conſtruction, neither as they have reference to the words precedent, or as they ſtand by themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The words which go before are,</hi> viz. We have had two wicked Kings together. <hi>'Tis not expreſſed what Kings, or when they Reigned, which is very uncertain</hi> (Et ſi ipſi ad fundamentalia ſua ſtarent) <hi>which word</hi> ipſi <hi>is relative, and muſt refer</hi> ad proximum antecedens, <hi>and then it muſt be</hi> ipſi Reges) <hi>which is the proper and natural ſenſe of the words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It will not change the meaning of the words,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now moſt of the</hi> Innuendo's <hi>in this Indictment are naught, becauſe they do not aſcertain the ſubject matter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, by the word</hi> People <hi>(innuendo <hi>the People of</hi>
                  </hi> England) <hi>may be as well intended any other People, becauſe there was no previous Diſcourſe of the People of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then follow theſe words,</hi> We have had two wicked Kings now together, <hi>(innuendo <hi>King</hi>
                  </hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt and Second</hi>) <hi>which may be as well intended of King</hi> Ethelred <hi>and</hi> Alfred, <hi>becauſe the words denote a time paſt, and therefore cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly intend the King, of whom there was no precedent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37883:39"/>And the Rule is,</hi> De dubiis &amp; generalibus benignior Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia recipienda eſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, thoſe words are inſenſible, and indeed impoſſible, for we cannot have two wicked Kings</hi> together, <hi>it ought to be ſucceſſively.</hi>

                  <hi>Then to ſay,</hi> we ſhall Conquer our Enemies, <hi>cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Enemies of the King, becauſe the word</hi> Enemies <hi>is of a large ſenſe; for Man, by reaſon of his Sins and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hath many Enemies, and poſſibly ſuch might be intended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If therefore it be doubtful what Enemies were meant, if it ſhall not be in the power of a Clerk, by an</hi> innuendo <hi>to make Words of another ſenſe than what they will naturally bear, nor to help where they are inſenſible, as in this Caſe: If there was no precedent Diſcourſe either of Kings, People, or Enemies, which muſt be proved by the Evidence, then is this Indictment naught, and therefore Iudgment ought to be arreſted.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis laid in this Indictment, that the words were ſpoken to ſtir up Rebellion, and to depoſe the King, and 'tis ſo found by the Verdict of twelve Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which aggravates the offence is, That it was ſpoken in a publick Aſſembly to the People, which muſt be intended the People of</hi> England, <hi>for to ſuch the Defendant Preached, and to them he declared the power given unto him by God, to heal them by Prayer: Then he tells them that their King is wicked, and having inſinuated this Doctrine into their Minds, he then bids them ſtand to their Principles in oppoſing and ſubduing wicked Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis objected that there ought to have been a precedent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the King, but the Preſidents are otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> 33 H. 8. Rot. 17. <hi>There was an Indictment againſt the Lord</hi> Grey, <hi>for words ſpoken againſt the King, without ſetting forth any precedent Diſcourſe of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So was my Lord</hi> Cobham<hi>'s Caſe in</hi> 12 Jac. <hi>for that he</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie dixit &amp; pro palavit haec verba, viz. It will never be well for <hi>England,</hi> until the King and his Cubbs are killed, <hi>without an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that the words were ſpoken</hi> de Rege.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in</hi> William<hi>'s Caſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Roll Rep. 88.</note> 
                  <hi>Reported by my Lord</hi> Rolls, <hi>who was Indicted for High Treaſon, for writing two Books, in which were many Traiterous Aſſertions, but no Averment of any previous Diſcourſe concerning the King, all theſe Indictments were thus,</hi> viz. Dixit <hi>ſuch words</hi> de Domino Rege.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:37883:39"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Indictment is good in form if the words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained amount to Treaſon; now they do import Treaſon or not, if they do import it, then 'tis unneceſſary to aver that they were ſpoken</hi> de Rege, <hi>becauſe it cannot be intended to be Treaſon againſt any other King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If a Man ſhould ſay that he would go to</hi> Whitehal <hi>and kill the King; 'tis not neceſſary to averr any precedent Diſcourſe</hi> de Rege.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Actions on the Caſe for Words, there muſt be an Averment of the perſon, becauſe many men are of the ſame Name; but in Indictments the form will govern the Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Several Traitors have ſuffered Death in ſuch Caſes as this at Bar, and many learned Men in all Ages have attended this Court, and this Objection was never made till now; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Preſidents being without this Averment</hi> de Rege, <hi>where the overt Act is by words, Iudgment was prayed againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Curia. <hi>Words may be an overt Act; but then they muſt be ſo certain and poſitive, as plainly to denote the intention of the ſpeaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If a Man ſhould tell another that he would drive the King out of</hi> England; <hi>there needs no averment that ſuch words were ſpoken</hi> de Rege, <hi>becauſe they tend immediately to depoſe the King; but if he had ſaid that he would go to</hi> Whitehal <hi>and deſtroy his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that is not Treaſon without an Averment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iudgment was arreſted.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Caſe was compared to other Actions in inferior Courts, which if removed by</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>the Bail below are diſcharged of courſe.</hi>

                  <hi>And therefore it hath been adjudged,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This</hi> Scire Facias <hi>is brought too ſoon, for there ought to go an</hi> Alias &amp; Pluries Retorn' habend. <hi>before the Return of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longata, <hi>and then, and not before, the</hi> Scire Facias <hi>is properly brought.</hi>

                  <hi>and the</hi> Scire Facias <hi>is well brought, and this grounded upon the Statute of</hi> W. 2. <hi>which directs Pledges to be taken before the delivery of the Goods: It

               <p>
                  <hi>Now as to the removing of the Pleint by</hi> Certiorari <hi>that makes the Caſe more ſtrong in the Plaintiffs behalf, becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it ſelf</hi> una cum omnibus ea tangen. <hi>is removed; but by an</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>the perſon is only removed, and the Court hath thereby a Iuriſdiction over his Cauſe, which the inferior Court hath loſt, becauſe it hath loſt his Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This</hi> Scire Facias <hi>is not brought too ſoon, as hath been objected, for 'tis in vain to bring an</hi> Alias &amp; Pluries <hi>after the Sheriff had returned</hi> Elongat'; <hi>'tis like the common Caſe where a</hi> Scire Facias <hi>is brought againſt the Bail and</hi> Non eſt inventus <hi>is returned, after which there never was an</hi> Alias <hi>or</hi> Pluries Capias.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Adminiſtration was granted by a peculiar to the next of Kin of the Infant, and an Appeal was brought in the</hi> Arches <hi>by the next of Kin of the Father to revoke that Adminiſtration.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>argued this Term for the Plaintiff in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Statute gives a power to the Ordinary to take Bonds of ſuch perſons to whom Adminiſtration is committed, the Forms of which Bonds are expreſſed in the Act, and the Conditions are to make a true and perfect Inventory, and to exhibit it into the Regiſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath alſo a power to diſtribute what remains after Debts, Funeral Charges and Expences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus the Law ſtands now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then as to the Caſe at the Barr three things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If a Man dies inteſtate leaving two Sons and no Wife, each hath a Moiety of his perſonal Eſtate immediately veſted in him, ſo that if one Brother ſhould afterwards die inteſtate the other ſhall have the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If an Intereſt be veſted in two, then by this Statute the like Intereſt is veſted in one, ſo that if he die Inteſtate his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator ſhall have the Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If ſo, then the conſequence will be, that in this caſe Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration</hi> de bonis non <hi>of the firſt Inteſtate ſhall go to the next of Kin of the Infant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By</hi> Intereſt <hi>is meant a Right to ſue for a ſhare after Debts paid, which</hi> Intereſt <hi>every perſon hath in a</hi> choſe in action: <hi>As if a Man doth covenant with two, that they ſhall have ſuch an Eſtate after Debts paid, an</hi> Intereſt veſts <hi>in them by this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and if they die, it goes to their Executors, ſuch alſo is the</hi> Intereſt <hi>of every Reſiduary Legatee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if any of them die before the Reſidue can be diſtributed, the Wife or Children of him ſo dying ſhall have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to make this more clear it will be neceſſary to conſider how the Law ſtood before the making of this Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the Common Law neither the Wife, Child or next of Kin had any Right to a Share of the Inteſtates Eſtate, but the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary was to diſtribute it according to his Conſcience to pious Vſes, and ſometimes the Wife and Children might be amongſt the number of thoſe whom he appointed to receive it; but the Law entruſted him with the ſole diſpoſition of it.</hi>

<note place="margin">13 E. 1. c. 19.</note> 2. <hi>he was bound to pay the Inteſtate's Debts ſo far as he had Aſſets, which at the Common Law he was not bound to do, and an Action of Debt would then, and not before,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Statute of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">* 31 E. 1. c. 11.</note> 31 E. 1. <hi>was made, by which he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred to grant Admſtration to the next of Kin, and moſt lawful Friend of the Inteſtate;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Inſt. 133. b. 2 Inſt. 397. 9 Co. Henſloes <hi>Caſe.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and by this Statute the perſon to whom Adminiſtration was committed might have an Action to recover the Inteſtate's Eſtate, for at the Common Law he had no remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But then afterwards the Statute of</hi> 21 H. 8. cap. 5. <hi>Enacts,</hi> That the Ordinary ſhall grant Adminiſtration to the Widow or next of Kin of the perſon deceaſed, or to both; <hi>and this was the firſt Law which gave any Intereſt to the Wife, to whom Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration being once granted the power of the Ordinary was determined,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hob. 83. 1 Cro. 62, 202.</note> 
                  <hi>and he could not repeal it at his pleaſure as he might at the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But after the making of this Statute many miſchiefs did ſtill remain, becauſe the Adminiſtration being once committed, the perſon to whom it was granted, had the whole Eſtate, and the reſt of the Relations of the deceaſed were undone; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if his Children were under Age, or beyond the Seas, and a Stranger had got Adminiſtration, it would have been a Bar to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus it continued many years, the Ordinary ſtill making diſtribution as he thought fit, taking only a Bond from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom he granted Adminiſtration for the purpoſes aforeſaid, and ſometimes to diſpoſe the Surplus after Debts and Legacies, as he ſhould direct, and no Prohibition was granted to remedy theſe inconveniences till about the</hi> 12th <hi>year of King</hi> James the Firſt.
<note place="margin">Hob. 83.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now by this Act a good remedy is provided againſt theſe miſchiefs, and 'tis ſuch which takes away the Cauſes thereof, which is, that the Adminiſtrator ſhall not have the whole Eſtate, but that a Diſtribution ſhall be made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Title of the Act ſhews the meaning thereof to be for the better Settlement of Inteſtates Eſtates, and the Body of it ſhews how Diſtribution ſhall be made; ſo that ſuch Bonds which were uſually given by the Adminiſtrator before this Law to make Diſtribution, as the Ordinary ſhould direct, are now taken away, and other Forms are preſcribed; and there can be no remedy taken upon ſuch new Bonds till the Ordinary hath appointed the Diſtribution, ſo that in effect this Act makes the Will of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dying inteſtate, and tells what ſhare his Relations ſhall have;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37883:42"/>and 'tis probable that the Cuſtom of</hi> London <hi>might guide the Parliament in the making of this Law, which Cuſtom diſtributes the Eſtate of a Freeman amongſt his Wife and Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſhews that an Intereſt is veſted in them, which goes to the Adminiſtrator, the conſequence whereof is very conſiderable, for if ſuch Children ſhould marry they have a Security by this Act that a Portion ſhall be paid; and if the Wife ſhould take another Husband he will be entituled to her ſhare, and this may be a means of giving credit in the World, when the certainty of their Portions are ſo well known and ſecured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis ſuch an Intereſt which is known in the Law and may be compared to that in Sir</hi> Thomas Palmer's Caſe,
<note place="margin">5 Co. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>who ſold</hi> 1600 <hi>Cord of Wood to a Man, who aſſigned it to another, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Vendor ſold</hi> 2000 <hi>Cord to one</hi> Maynard <hi>to be taken at his Election, the Aſſignee of the firſt perſon cutt</hi> 600 <hi>Cord and</hi> Maynard <hi>carried it away, thereupon an Action was brought and the Plaintiff had Iudgment, becauſe the firſt Vendee had an Intereſt veſted in him which he might well aſſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Caſe is a plain proof that a Man may have an Intereſt in a Chattle without a Property, and ſuch an Intereſt which gives the perſon a remedy to recover, and where there is a remedy there muſt be a Right, for they are convertibles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis not a new thing in the Law that a contingent Intereſt in the Anceſtor ſhall ſurvive to the Heir;</hi>

                  <hi>as if a Man be ſeized of the Mannor of</hi> S. <hi>and covenants that when</hi> B. <hi>ſhall make a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him of the Mannor of</hi> D. <hi>then he will ſtand ſeized of the ſaid Mannor of</hi> S. <hi>to the uſe of the Covenantee and his Heirs, who dyed leaving Iſſue an Heir, who was then an Infant,</hi> B. <hi>made a Feoffment to the Covenantor accordingly; it was held that no Right deſcended to the Heir of the Covenantee, but only a poſſibility of an Vſe which might have veſted in the Anceſtor, and therefore the Heir ſhall claim it by deſcent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis like a Debt to be paid at a day to come,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if this Act makes a Will it ought to be conſtrued as ſuch, and it cannot be denied, that if this Caſe had happened upon a Will the Executor of the Son would have a very good Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis a weak Objection to affirm that this Law was made to eſtabliſh the practice of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and that 'tis only explanatory of the Statutes of</hi> Ed. 3. <hi>and</hi> H. 8. <hi>becauſe 'tis
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37883:43"/>plainly introductory of a new Law, for Diſtribution is now made otherwiſe than it was before.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>An Intereſt is veſted where there is but one Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the better underſtanding of this Point the Clauſe in the Act ought to be conſidered, which is,</hi> viz. If there be no Wife then to be diſtributed amongſt the Children, if no Child, then to the next of Kin of the Inteſtate; <hi>upon which Clauſe theſe Objections have been made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>That 'tis inſignificant, becauſe the Statute of</hi> H. 8. <hi>gives the right of Adminiſtration to the Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Diſtribution cannot be made where there is but one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That this Clauſe ought to be conſtrued according to the Law in the Spiritual Courts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Now as to the firſt Objection 'tis true, that before this Act the Child had a Right of Adminiſtration, but that Right was only</hi> perſonal; <hi>ſo that if he had died before he had adminiſtred his Executor or Adminiſtrator could not have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, many inconveniences did attend this</hi> perſonal Right of Adminiſtration, <hi>which are now prevented by the veſting of an</hi> Intereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For when the Right was</hi> perſonal <hi>and the Adminiſtrator gave Bond with Sureties to adminiſter truly, and the Ordinary had appointed Diſtribution to be made, the Adminiſtrator was bound to perform it though not in equal degree; and if he died before the Eſtate was got in, it was loſt for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now by this Clauſe Diſtribution muſt be made equally,</hi> viz. <hi>one third part of the Surplus to the Wife, the reſt by equal portions to the Children, ſo that what was very incertain before, and almoſt at the Will of the Ordinary, is now reduced to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; and therefore an Intereſt muſt veſt in ſuch perſons to whom ſuch equal Diſtributions of filial Portions are given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Object. <hi>That Diſtribution cannot be made where there is but one Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>This alſo is true in propriety of Speech and taking the Word</hi> diſtribute <hi>in the ſtrict ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this was never intended by the Statute as may plainly appear upon the conſtruction of the whole; for the Word</hi> Children <hi>doth comprehend a</hi> Child <hi>and more, and the form of the Bond directed by this Statute is that the Adminiſtrator ſhall deliver the Goods to ſuch perſon and perſons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which ſhews that one
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37883:43"/>is comprehended, and therefore</hi> Diſtribuere <hi>in this Caſe is no more than</hi> Tribuere, <hi>and muſt be ſo taken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

<note place="margin">Cro. Car. 208.</note> 
                  <hi>which was Baron and Feme Adminiſtratrix of her former Husband recover in Debt; the Feme died, the ſurviving Husband brought a</hi> Scire Facias <hi>to have Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and upon a Demurrer all the Court, but</hi> Hide, <hi>agreed that the</hi> Scire Facias <hi>would not lie for the Husband alone, becauſe it was a debt demanded by the Adminiſtratrix in</hi> auter droit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Statute hath not wholly altered the Common Law in this matter; it only limits the Practice of Eccleſiaſtical Courts and makes proviſion for particular purpoſes,</hi> viz. <hi>That Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution ſhall be made to the Wife and Children, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which is ſo far introductory of a new Law, but no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that the Right of Adminiſtration is as it was before, and therefore muſt be granted to the next of Kin of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Court hath no power to grant a Prohibition in ſuch a Caſe, and if it ſhould, 'tis the firſt which ever was granted of this kind, for it ought not to be determined here, but in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Court, which hath an original Iurisdiction of this Cauſe, and the Appeal is</hi> in proprio loco.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>anſwered, that the contrary was very plain, for here have been many Prohibitions granted even upon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37883:44"/>this very Act; and the Queſtion now before the Court is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of Diſtribution, but the Right of Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether any Intereſt is veſted in the Son or not? 'Tis true, the Eſtate in Law goes to the Adminiſtrator, but the Intereſt and Right to ſue for and to recover the Eſtate goes to the Son; ſo that if he ſhould die before he is in actual poſſeſſion, his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator ſhall have it to pay Debts and to diſtribute,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Caſe of a Will, if a Man ſhould deviſe his Eſtate to his Wife and Children after Debts and Legacies paid, an Intereſt veſts in thoſe Children, which doth not differ from the Caſe at the Bar, but that in the one Caſe the Teſtator makes the Will, and in the other 'tis made by an Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some Inconveniencies have been already mentioned if the Law ſhould be otherwiſe taken, but there be many more; for if no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſhould veſt in the Child till actual Diſtribution he could neither be truſted for his Education or Neceſſaries whilſt living, and no body would bury him if he ſhould happen to die before the year and a day, for the Funeral Charges would be loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It will likewiſe occaſion delays in Adminiſtrators to make Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution in hopes of gain, neither will any honeſt man take an Adminiſtration upon himſelf, becauſe he can neither pay Mony ſafely, or take a Releaſe, for if the Infant die before diſtribution it is void.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Patent for Printing of</hi> Law-Books <hi>was granted to one</hi> More, <hi>on the</hi> 19th <hi>day of</hi> January, <hi>in the</hi> 15th <hi>year of King</hi> James <hi>the</hi> I. <hi>And when that Patent was expired, another was granted to</hi> Atkyns <hi>and others, on the</hi> 15th <hi>day of</hi> November, <hi>in the</hi> 12th <hi>year of King</hi> Charles <hi>the</hi> II.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> 23.

                  <hi>'tis true, the Iudgment was againſt the Plaintiff; but upon a Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror brought in Parliament that Iudgment was reverſed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now to apply this to the principal Caſe; 'tis to be conſidered, that theſe Books for which the ſole Printing was ſo claimed, were of a publick nature and importance, relating to the good and benefit of the Subjects; and ſo likewiſe are Blank Bonds, for there may be falſe and vitious Impreſſions, to the ruin and deſtruction of many innocent people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as a farther Argument that the King hath this Prerogative, 'tis likewiſe to be conſidered, that where no individual perſon can claim a Property in a thing there the King hath a Right veſted in him by Law; and it cannot be pretended that any particular perſon hath a Right to Print thoſe Bonds, therefore the finding that ſuch were printed by the Company for above</hi> 40 <hi>years, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material; becauſe there being an inherent Prerogative in the King, whenever he exerts it, all other perſons are bound up who were at liberty before.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To prove which, the Iudgment in the Caſe of the</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Company is expreſs in point; for before that Patent the ſubject had liberty to Trade to thoſe places prohibited by that Grant; but afterwards they were reſtrained by that Grant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">11 Co. 84.</note> 
                  <hi>'tis not like that of the ſole Grant of making</hi> Cards, <hi>which hath been adjudged void, and with great reaſon, becauſe that Grant reached to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a whole Trade, and therefore differs from this Caſe; for the Defendant may print other Inſtruments or Books, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Trade in ſome other lawful and profitable Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and ſo might the Merchants in the Caſe of the</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Company, for they were reſtrained by the Patent as to particular places, but might Trade to any other part of the World.</hi>

                  <hi>Neither will the Subjects in general receive any prejudice by this or ſuch like Grants; for if the Patentees make ill uſe of their Priviledges, tho' it cannot be properly called an Office, yet 'tis a Truſt, and a</hi> Scire Facias <hi>will lie to repeal their Grants.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as to that, 'tis not a new thing to object, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch Grants, yet other perſons have inſiſted on a Right to Print, and have printed accordingly.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Printing, as 'tis a manual Occupation, makes no alteration in this Caſe, for the King hath as great a Prerogative in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing that is of a publick Nature, as he hath in Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</hi>

                  <hi>Now conſidering Printing as an Art excluſive from the thing printed, this Patent is not good: For if a Man invent a new Art, and another ſhould learn it before the Inventor can obtain a Patent, if afterwards granted 'tis void.</hi>

                  <hi>The Iury found this Special Verdict following,</hi> Viz. <hi>That</hi> William Holms <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee of the Lands in queſtion, who by his laſt Will, dated in the year</hi> 1633. <hi>deviſed it to</hi> Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Hopkins <hi>for Life; Remainder to her firſt Son, and to the Heirs of the Body of ſuch firſt Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and for default of ſuch Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to his Couſin</hi> W. <hi>with ſeveral Remainders over.

               <p>Dorothy Hopkins <hi>had Iſſue</hi> Richard, <hi>who had Iſſue</hi> Henry, <hi>who had Iſſue a Daughter, now the Defendant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion was, Whether the Son of</hi> Dorothy <hi>did take an</hi> Eſtate Tail <hi>by this Will, to him and to the Heirs of his Body</hi> in general, <hi>or an</hi> Eſtate in Tail Male.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe who argued for the Plaintiff held, that the Son had an Eſtate in Tail Male; and this ſeems plain by the intention of the Teſtator, that if</hi> Dorothy <hi>had Iſſue Daughters, they ſhould have no benefit, for no proviſion is made for any ſuch by the Will; and therefore the Daughter of her Son can have no Eſtate, who is more remote to the Teſtator.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff claimed the Lands by virtue of the Statute of</hi> 4 &amp; 5 Ph. &amp; Mar. cap. 8. <hi>by which 'tis enacted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it ſhall not be lawful for any perſon to take away any Maid or Woman Child unmarried, and within the Age of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years from the Parents or Guardian in Soccage; and that if any Woman Child or Maiden being above the Age of twelve years, and under the Age of ſixteen, do at any time aſſent or agree to ſuch perſon that ſhall make any Contract of Matrimony (contrary to the Form of the Act) that then the next of Kin of ſuch Woman Child or Maid to whom the Inheritance ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, return or come after the deceaſe of the ſame Woman Child or Maid, ſhall from the time of ſuch Aſſent and Agreement have, hold and enjoy all ſuch Lands, Tenements and Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the ſaid Woman Child or Maid had in Poſſeſſion, Reverſion or Remainder at the time of ſuch Aſſent and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during the Life of ſuch perſon that ſhall ſo contract Matrimony, and after the deceaſe of ſuch perſon ſo contracting Matrimony, that then the ſaid Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall deſcend, revert, remain and come to ſuch perſon or perſons as they ſhould have done in caſe this Act had never been made, other than him only that ſo ſhall contract Matrimony.</p>
               <p>Benjamin Tibboth <hi>being ſeiſed in Fee of the Lands in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to the value of</hi> 700 l. per annum <hi>had Iſſue a Son and four Daughters; the Son had Iſſue</hi> Ruth <hi>his only Daughter, who was married to the Defendant</hi> Gore; <hi>her Father died in the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37883:54"/>time of her Grandfather, and her Mother fearing that this Daughter might be ſtoln from her, applies her ſelf to my Lady</hi> Gore, <hi>and entreats her to take this Daughter into her Houſe, which ſhe did accordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lady had a Son then in</hi> France, <hi>ſhe ſent for him and married him to this</hi> Ruth, <hi>ſhe being then under the Age of ſixteen years, without the Conſent of her Mother, who was her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion was whether this was a Forfeiture of her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate during Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was proved at the Trial that the Mother had made a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the Leſſor of the Plaintiff, that in caſe he recovered ſhe ſhould have</hi> 1000 l. <hi>and the Chirds of the Eſtate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was not admitted to be a Witneſs.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff could not prove any thing to make a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore was nonſuited.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>THE Plaintiff being a Merchant brought an Action upon a Bill of Exchange,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Swift <hi>endorſed this Bill to</hi> Allen <hi>or Order, and</hi> Allen <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed it to</hi> Claxton.</p>

                  <hi>The Mony not being paid</hi> Claxton <hi>brings his Action againſt</hi> Hughes, <hi>and recovers, but did not take out Execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Afterwards he ſued Mr.</hi> Swift, <hi>who was the firſt Endorſer, and he pleads the firſt Recovery againſt</hi> Hughes <hi>in barr to this Action, and avers that it was for the ſame Bill, and that they were the ſame Parties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this Plea the Plaintiff demurred, and the Defendant joyned in the Demurrer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>argued that it was a good Barr, becauſe the Plaintiff had his Election to bring his Action againſt either of the Endorſers or againſt the Drawer, but not againſt all; and that he had now determined his Election by ſuing the Drawer, and ſhall not go back again though he never have Execution; for this is not in the nature of a joint Action which may be brought againſt all. 'Tis true that it may he made joint or ſeveral by the Plaintiff; but when he has made his choice by ſuing of one he ſhall never ſue the reſt, becauſe the Action ſounds in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, which are uncertain before the Iudgment, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are made certain,</hi> &amp; tranſeunt in rem judicatam, <hi>and is as effectual in Law as a Releaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As in</hi> Trover <hi>the Defendant pleaded that at another time the Plaintiff had recovered againſt another perſon for the ſame Goods ſo much Damages,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cro. 73. Yelv. 65. Brown <hi>verſus</hi> Wootton.</note> 
                  <hi>and had the Defendant in Execution; and upon a Demurrer this was held a good Plea; for though in that Caſe it was objected, that a Iudgment and Execution was no ſatisfaction unleſs the Mony was paid, yet it was adjudged that the cauſe of Action being againſt ſeveral, for which Damages
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37883:55"/>were to be recovered; and becauſe a Sum certain was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered againſt one, that is a good diſcharge againſt all the other, but 'tis otherwiſe in Debt, becauſe each is liable to the entire Sum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chief Iuſtice. If the Plaintiff had accepted of a Bond from the firſt Drawer in ſatisfaction of this Mony, it had been a good Barr to any Action which might have been brought againſt the other Indorſers for the ſame; and as this Caſe is the Drawer is ſtill liable, and if he fail in payment, the firſt Endorſer is chargeable, becauſe if he make Endorſement upon a bad Bill, 'tis Equity and good Conſcience that the Endorſee may reſort to him to make it good: But the other Iuſtices being againſt the Opinion of the Chief Iuſtice, Iudgment was given for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant pleaded, that after the</hi> 25th <hi>day of</hi> Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>and</hi> before <hi>the day of the appearance, he did render himſelf to the Officer in diſcharge of this Bond, and to this the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff demurred.</hi>

                  <hi>who plead that after the Recognizance, and before the Iudgment againſt the Principal affirmed, he rendred himſelf to the Marſhal in diſcharge of his Bail, that this is not a good Plea, but that the Sureties are ſtill liable,</hi>

                  <hi>But if a Iudgment be had in this Court,</hi>

                  <hi>and a Writ of Error brought in the</hi> Exchequer-Chamber, <hi>and pending that Writ of Error the Principal is rendred, the Bail in the Action are thereby diſcharged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued on the other ſide,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
                  <hi>that this is not the like Caſe of Bail upon a Writ of Error, for the Condition of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance and that of a Bond for Appearance are different in their nature; the one is barely that the Party ſhall appear on ſuch a day, the other is that he ſhall not only appear and render
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37883:56"/>his Body to Priſon, but the Bail likewiſe do undertake to pay the Debt, if Iudgment ſhould be againſt the Principal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now where the Condition is only for an Appearance at a day if the Party render himſelf either before or after the day, 'tis not good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chief Iuſtice. If the Party render himſelf to the Officer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of Appearance he is to ſee that he appear at the day, either by keeping of him in Cuſtody or letting of him to Bail, the end of the Arreſt is to have his Body here.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>If he had not been bailed then he had ſtill remained in Cuſtody, and the Plaintiff would have his proper remedy; but being once let to Bail, and not appearing in Court according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Bond, that ſeems to be the fault of the Defendant who had his Body before the day of Appearance.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>So where a man made a Leaſe for life and died, and then his Heir ſuffered a Recovery of the ſame Land without making an actual Entry, this is an abſolute</hi> Diſſeiſin, <hi>becauſe the Leſſee had an Eſtate for life; but if he had been Tenant at Will, it might be otherwiſe.</hi>

                  <hi>becauſe an</hi> Executor de ſon tort <hi>cannot have any intereſt in a Term, and for this there is an expreſs Authority in this Court, which was thus,</hi> viz. <hi>A Leaſe in Reverſion for years was granted to a man who died inteſtate, his Wife, before ſhe had adminiſtred, ſold this Term to the Defendant, and afterwards ſhe obtained Letters of Adminiſtration, and made a Conveiance of the ſame Term to the

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither can any Entry or Claim make the Defendant an</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor de ſon tort <hi>of a Term for years, becauſe a wrongful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try can never gain any Eſtate but a Fee-ſimple; for 'tis not to be ſatisfied with any particular or certain Eſtate, as for life or years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be gained by Act of Law, becauſe that abhors all manner of wrong.</hi>

                  <hi>To this it may be anſwered, that the Defendant doth not claim by colour of any Grant; if he did, then he might be a Diſſeiſor at the Election of him in the Reverſion; and this was the very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference taken in the Caſe of</hi> Blunden <hi>and</hi> Baugh.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now a Man may be Executor of his own wrong of a Term for years, as appears even in that caſe cited out of</hi> Moor <hi>on the other ſide, and if ſo, the Defendant muſt be liable to this Action.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Statute may be expounded as well againſt a wrongful as a rightful Executor, 'tis plain here is a</hi> Diſſeſin, <hi>and the Law is now ſettled, that it ſhall be in the election of him in the Reverſion to make it ſo.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Reſp. <hi>Such damages muſt be anſwered out of his own Eſtate; for even in the Caſe of a rightful Executor, if he commit</hi> Waſte,

               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, Tenants by</hi> Elegit <hi>or by Statute are not within this Statute, becauſe</hi> Waſte <hi>by them committed is no wrong; for if they ſhould fell the Timber, it ſinks the Debt, and the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizor may have a</hi> Scire Facias ad computandum.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now here was Mony levyed by virtue of this Act, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie did ariſe by reaſon of the Diſtreſs, and an Order was made by the Iuſtices, which according to the letter and meaning of the Act ought to be final; the intention whereof was to prevent the charge and trouble of poor Men in Suits at Law about ſmall Matters, and therefore it gave the Iuſtices power to determine particular Offences and Oppreſſions.</hi>

                  <hi>The Chief Iuſtice was firſt of Opinion, that this might be Maintenance, but that it was not Barretry unleſs it appeared that the Defendant did know that</hi> C. <hi>had no cauſe of Action after it was brought.</hi>

                  <hi>If a Man ſhould be arreſted for a trifling Cauſe, or for no Cauſe, this is no Barretry, though 'tis a ſign of a very ill Chriſtian, it being againſt the expreſs Word of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Man may lay out mony in behalf of another in Suits at Law to recover a juſt Right, and this may be done in reſpect of the Poverty of the Party; but if he lend mony to promote and ſtirr up Suits then he is a Barretor.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Defendant ought to anſwer full as much as the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is damnified; now how is it poſſible he ſhould be damnified ſo much by one and ſo little by the other?</hi>

                  <hi>in which the Caſe did ariſe upon the conſtruction of the words in a Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Viz. <hi>The Teſtator being ſeiſed in Fee, had Iſſue</hi> Two Sons and Four Daughters: <hi>He made his Will, and deviſed his Eſtate, (being in Houſes) by theſe words.</hi> Viz. Irem, I give and bequeath to my Son <hi>Nicholas Price,</hi> my Houſes in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and if itpleaſe God to take away my Son, then I give my Eſtate to my four Daughters <hi>(naming them)</hi> ſhare and ſhare alike) and if it pleaſe God to take away any of my ſaid Daughters before Marriage, then I give her or their part to the reſt ſurviving. And if all my <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> dye <hi>without Iſſue,</hi> then I give my ſaid Houſes to my Siſter <hi>Anne Warner,</hi> and her Heirs.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:37883:64"/>
               <p>Nicholas Price <hi>entred and died without Iſſue, then the four Siſters entred, and</hi> Margaret <hi>the eldeſt married</hi> Thellwel, <hi>and died, leaving Iſſue a Son, who was the Leſſor of the Plaintiff, who inſiſted upon his Title to a fourth part of the Houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion was, what Eſtate the Daughters took by this Will, whether</hi> joint <hi>Eſtates for Life, or ſeveral Remainders in Tail?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If only</hi> joint <hi>Eſtates for Life, then the Plaintiff, as Heir to his Mother, will not be entituled to a fourth part; if ſeveral Remainders in Tail, then the Father will have it during his Life, as Tenant by the Curteſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Caſe was argued this Term by Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>for the Plaintiff: And in</hi> Hillary-<hi>Term following by Councel for the Defendant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiffs Council inſiſted, that they took joint Eſtates for Life, and this ſeemed to be the intent of the Teſtator, by the words in his Will, the firſt Clauſe whereof was,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Viz. I give and bequeath my Houſes in W. to <hi>Nicholas Price: <hi>Now by theſe words an Eſtate for Life only paſſed to him, and not an Inheritance, for there was nothing to be done, or any thing to be paid out of it.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The next Clauſe is,</hi> Viz. If it pleaſe God to take away my Son, then I give my Eſtate to my four Daughters, ſhare and ſhare alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now theſe words cannot give the Daughters a Fee-ſimple, by any intendment whatſoever; but if any word in this Clauſe ſeems to admit of ſuch a Conſtruction, it muſt be the word</hi> Eſtate, <hi>which ſometimes ſignifies the Land it ſelf, and ſometimes the Eſtate in the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But here the word</hi> Eſtate <hi>cannot create a Fee-ſimple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Teſtator gave his Daughters that Eſtate which he had given to his Son before, and that was only for Liſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then follow the words</hi> ſhare and ſhare alike; <hi>and that only makes them Tenants in Common.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The next Clauſe is,</hi> Viz. If it pleaſe God to take away any of my ſaid Daughters before Marriage, then I give her or their part to the reſt ſurviving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe words as they are penned can have no influence upon the Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Then followeth the laſt Clauſe,</hi> Viz. And if all my Sons and Daughters dye without Iſſue, then I give, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe words create no Eſtate tail in the Daughters; for the Teſtator having two Sons and four Daughters, it cannot be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37883:65"/>collected by theſe words, how they ſhall take, and by conſequence it cannot be an Eſtate Tail by implication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now ſuppoſe one of the Daughters ſhould dye without Iſſue, 'tis uncertain who ſhall have her part; and therefore there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no appointment in what order this Eſtate ſhall go, it cannot be an Eſtate Tail, and to maintain this Opinion, this Caſe was cited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One</hi> Collier <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee of three Houſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cro. 655. Gilbert <hi>verſus</hi> Witty.</note> 
                  <hi>and had Iſſue three Sons,</hi> John, Robert <hi>and</hi> Richard, <hi>he deviſed to each of them a Houſe in Fee, Proviſo, if all my Children dye without Iſſue of their Bodies then the Houſes to be to his Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The two eldeſt Sons died without Iſſue, the younger had Iſſue a Daughter, who married the Leſſor of the Plaintiff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion was, Whether by the death of the eldeſt Son without Iſſue, there was a croſs Remainder to</hi> Richard, <hi>and the Heirs of his Body, or whether the Wife ſhall take imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or expect till after the Death of all the Sons without Iſſue? And it was adjudged, that the Wife ſhall take imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and that there were no croſs Remainders, nor any Eſtate by implication, becauſe it was a deviſe to them ſeverally by expreſs limitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that if no Eſtate tail ariſeth to the Daughters in this Caſe by implication,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Eliz. Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>verſus</hi> Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer.</note> 
                  <hi>then 'tis no more than a deviſe to his Iſſue, which extends to them all, and gives only an Eſtate for Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Defendant it was argued,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have no Eſtate Tail by implication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was agreed that</hi> Nicholas <hi>had only an Eſtate for Life, and that the word</hi> Eſtate <hi>in this caſe means the Houſes, and not the Intereſt in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, there is no expreſs Limitation of any Eſtate to them, but there is an expreſs determination of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if this be not an Eſtate Tail by implication, then the words</hi> dying without Iſſue <hi>are void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A deviſe to his Son,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">More 127.</note> 
                  <hi>and if he dye not having a Son, then 'tis deviſed over, This is an Eſtate tail in Remainder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be a doubt who ſhall take firſt; for the Daughters ſhall take it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dyer 333.</note> 
                  <hi>and after them, as 'tis moſt natural, the eldeſt Son; for where there is the ſame proximity of Blood, the Eſtate ſhall go to the eldeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for inſtance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hob. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>one</hi> Chapman <hi>being ſeiſed in Fee of two Houſes, and having three Brothers, deviſed the Houſe which</hi> A. <hi>dwelt in to his ſaid three Brothers, and the Houſe in which his Brother</hi> Thomas Chapman <hi>did dwell, he deviſed to the ſaid</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37883:65"/>
                  <hi>paying ſo much,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or elſe to remain to the Family of the Teſtator, provided that the Houſes be not ſold, but go to the next of the Males, and the blood of the Males.</hi> Thomas <hi>died without Iſſue, the eldeſt of the two ſurviving Brothers had Iſſue a Daughter, and died: the Queſtion was, whether that Daughter or the youngeſt Brother of the Teſtator ſhould have the Houſe? It was adjudged that the Daughter ſhould have it in tail. For the</hi> Proviſo <hi>that the Houſes be not ſold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>made it a tail; and the words</hi> viz. to remain to the Family <hi>muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the eldeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this be not an Eſtate tail, then the Deviſe over to</hi> Anne Warner <hi>is void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Caſe of</hi> Gilbert <hi>and</hi> Witty, <hi>that moves upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon; for there every one took by a diſtinct and ſeparate Limitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Curia. <hi>In that Caſe all the Eſtate was limited diſtinctly to the three Sons; but in this 'tis otherwiſe, for the Teſtator had two Sons, and no Eſtate was limited to one of them before; then he ſaith,</hi> If all my Sons and Daughters dye without Iſſue, then, <hi>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus the Caſes differ, which creates the difficulty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But no reaſon can be given why this Court ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue Wills according to the Rules of Common Law, where an Eſtate by implication is ſo incertain; for when Men are ſick and yet have a diſpoſing power left they uſually write Nonſenſe, and the Iudges muſt rack their Brains to find out what is intended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This cannot be an Eſtate tail in the Daughters, and therefore the Heir muſt come in for his fourth part.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion was, Whether</hi> Ballivus probi homines &amp; Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes Burgi de Andover <hi>in</hi> Hampſhire, <hi>had power to keep a Fair at</hi> Wayehil <hi>in any one place where they pleaſe; the Bill being Exhibited to confine the Fair to a particular place; which Fair was granted to them by Charter from Queen</hi> Elizabeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They who would have it confin'd to a certain place, gave in Evidence, that the</hi> Hoſpitaller <hi>of</hi> Ewelme <hi>in</hi> Oxfordſhire, <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee of the Manor of</hi> Rambridge, <hi>within which Manor

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That this place was called</hi> Wayehil, <hi>and that the profits did ariſe by Piccage and Stallage, to the yearly value of</hi> 200 l.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was an ancient Fair held there by Preſcription before the Town of</hi> Andover <hi>had a Charter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That upon the late Surrender of Charters, the Town of</hi> Andover <hi>did likewiſe ſurrender and took a new Charter, in which liberty was given to them to keep this Fair in what place they would.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That both the Hoſpitaller and Parſon petitioned the King in Council, and obtained an Order to Try where the Fair ought to be kept, which was tried accordingly at the</hi> Exchequer <hi>Bar, and a Verdict for the Parſon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But certainly if the place be not limited by the King's Grant, they may keep it where they pleaſe, or rather where they can moſt conveniently, and if it be ſo limited, they may keep it in what part of ſuch place they will.</hi>

                  <hi>then the Statute of Limitations begins; as in an Action on the Caſe for words, if they are actionable in themſelves without alledging ſpecial da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, the Plaintiff will recover Damages from the time of the ſpeaking, and not according to what loſs may follow.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>So in the Caſe at Bar, tho' this be a continued impriſonment, yet ſo much as was before the Writ brought, is barred by the Statute.</hi>

                  <hi>As to the Objection, that the Cauſe of Action ariſeth beyond ſix years, tho' it doth appear ſo in the Declaration, yet that doth not exclude the Plaintiff, for there might have been Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs out before, or he might be diſabled by an Outlawry, which may be now reverſed; or he might be in Priſon and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged, from which time he hath ſix years to begin his Action, for being under either of theſe circumſtances the Statute doth not hurt him.</hi>

                  <hi>and upon a Demurrer the Queſtion was upon the Statute of</hi> 30 Car. 2. <hi>The Title whereof is,</hi> An Act to enable Creditors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Debts of Executors and Adminiſtrators of Executors in their own wrong, <hi>which is introductory of a new Law, and charges thoſe who were not chargeable before at the Common Law; but it enacts,</hi> That when Executors of perſons who are <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors de ſon tort,</hi> or Adminiſtrators, ſhall convert the Goods of any perſon deceaſed, that they ſhall be liable as their Teſtator or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate would have been.</p>
               <p>Gold <hi>held, that he ſhall not be charged, for where an Act of Parliament charges an Executor, in ſuch caſe an Adminiſtrator ſhall be likewiſe charged; but if an Adminiſtrator be charged, that ſhall never extend to an Executor.

               </p>
               <p>Pollexfen contra. <hi>There can be no reaſon given why the Act ſhould make an Adminiſtrator of an Adminiſtrator lyable to a</hi> Devaſtavit, <hi>and not an Adminiſtrator of an Executor</hi> de ſon tort <hi>for the miſchief will be the ſame, and therefore a rightful Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor who waſts the Teſtator's Goods ought to be charged.</hi>

                  <hi>the Plaintiffs declared, that in the Reign of</hi> H. 4. <hi>there was a Society of Merchants Adventurers in</hi> England, <hi>and that afterwards Queen</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth <hi>did by her Letters Patents incorporate them by the Name of</hi> the Governour and Company of the Merchants Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, &amp;c. <hi>and gave them Priviledge to trade into</hi> Holland, Zealand, Flanders, Brabant, <hi>the Country belonging to the Duke of</hi> Lunenburgh, <hi>and</hi> Hamburgh, <hi>prohibiting all others not free of that Company; by virtue whereof they did trade into thoſe parts, and had thereby great Priviledges and Advantages; that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant not being free of the ſaid Company did trade into thoſe Parts without their authority, and imported Goods from thence into this Kingdom</hi> ad damnum, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>and as to the other places he pleaded the Statute of</hi> Ed. 3. That the Seas ſhall be open to all Merchants to paſs with their Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize whither they pleaſe.</p>

                  <hi>The Plaintiff demurred, and the Defendant joined in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer.</hi>

                  <hi>This Caſe was now argued by Councel on both ſides.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Councel for the Plaintiff in their Arguments made theſe Points.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What Power the King had by his Prerogative to reſtrain his Subjects from trading to particular places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Admitting he had ſuch a Prerogative, whether an Action on the Caſe will lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the firſt Point it was ſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Magna Charta cap. 30. 2 Inſt. 57.</note> 
                  <hi>that all Trades muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Regulation, and that the Subject hath not an abſolute power to trade without the leave of the King; for it is ſaid in our Books</hi> Omnes Mercatores niſi publice prohibiti fuerint ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beant ſalvum &amp; ſecurum conductum, <hi>which is meant of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Strangers in Amity with us, and</hi> niſi publice prohibiti <hi>muſt be by the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if Merchants Strangers may be prohibited from coming into</hi> England, <hi>by the ſame reaſon the Kings Subjects may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to go out of the Kingdom; and for that purpoſe the Writ of</hi> Ne exeat Regnum <hi>was framed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">F. N. B. 85. 3 Inſt. 179.</note>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kings Prerogative in this and ſuch like Caſes is ſo much favoured by Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Leon. 9. More 172.</note> 
                  <hi>that he may by his Privy Seal command any of his Subjects to return out of a Foreign Nation or ſeize their Lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt Statute which regulates Trade is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">27 E. 3. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the Staple to certain places that perſons might not go about in Companies to trade without the King's Licence; and from thence came</hi> Markets; <hi>and if ſuch were kept without the King's Grant a</hi> Quo Warranto <hi>would lie againſt them who continued it, and the People, who frequented thoſe Markets were puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Fine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law is plain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">F. N. B. 125. 2 Roll. Abr. 140.</note> 
                  <hi>that the King is ſole Iudge of the place where Markets ſhall be kept; for if he grant one to be kept in ſuch a place which may not be convenient for the Country, yet the Subjects can go to no other, and if they do, the Owner of the Soil, where they meet, is liable to an Action at the Suit of the Grantee of the Market.</hi>

                  <hi>And if ſuch Corporations have power to judge and determine who are fit perſons to exerciſe Trades within their Iurisdiction, the King hath certainly a greater Prerogative to determine which of his Subjects are fit to trade to particular places excluſive from the Reſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The next thing to be conſidered is, what Acts of Parliament have either taken away or abridged the King's Prerogative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt is</hi> Magna Charta, viz. <hi>That all Merchants ſhall ſtay here</hi> niſi publice antea prohibiti, <hi>the meaning of which hath been already explained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond Statute is, that which the Defendant hath pleaded. In anſwer to which 'tis to be obſerved that a Preamble of any Statute Law is the beſt Expoſitor of it, becauſe it uſually men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the occaſion of its making; and this Act amongſt other
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:37883:77"/>Things and Petitions recites, that the King had granted to the Men of</hi> Flanders <hi>that the Staple of Wool ſhould be at</hi> Bruges, <hi>which Town had ordered that no Wool ſhould be ſold to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which was much to the damage of trading Merchants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now what is the Remedy in this Caſe? Why the King grants that they may buy Wool at ſuch prizes as they can agree, and carry it where they pleaſe, let the Seas be open,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that this Act had only a proſpect to remedy the abuſe of the Staple, which hath in no ſort abridged the King's Prerogative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If there ſhould be no Regulation of Trade by the Power and Prerogative of the King, what would become of the</hi> Turkey <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when it might be in the power of one Man to ruine all the Effects of our</hi> Engliſh <hi>Merchants there by a Misdemeanour? Therefore it ought to be looked after very ſtrictly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All Arguments which may be deduced from Monopolies will have no influence upon this Caſe, becauſe this Grant doth not barr the Subject of any precedent Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the ſecond Point 'tis not to be doubted, but that ſince they are abridged in Intereſt an Action on the Caſe will lie.</hi>

                  <hi>and no Continuances between it and the Declaration, therefore that could not be the Original to this Action, and that the Court might for that reaſon intend a Verdict without an Original, which is helped by the Statute of Jeofails.

                  <hi>The Defendant made conuſance as Bayliff of the Dean and Chapter of</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>for that the place where,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was within the Iurisdiction of the Leet of the ſaid Dean, who was ſeiſed of a Court Leet which was held there ſuch a day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that the Iury did preſent the Plaintiff (being a</hi> Tallow-Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler) <hi>for melting of ſtinking Tallow, to the annoyance of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for which he was amerced, and that the Amerciament was affered to</hi> 5 l. <hi>which not being paid, the Defendant by a</hi> Mandate <hi>of the ſaid Dean and Chapter, diſtreined the Tankard,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff replied</hi> de injuria ſua propria abſque hoc <hi>that he did melt Tallow to the annoyance of the Neighbours,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And upon a Demurrer to this Replication, it was argued this Term by Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>for the Defendant, and</hi> Tremaine <hi>for the Plaintiff: and afterwards in</hi> Michaelmas-<hi>Term</hi> 1 Will. &amp; Mariae, <hi>by Mr.</hi> Bonithan <hi>and Serjeant</hi> Thompſon <hi>for the Defendant.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>It was ſaid for the Defendant, that a Preſentment in a Court Leet which concerns the perſon (as in this Caſe) and not the

               <p>
                  <hi>But on the other ſide it was ſaid, that if ſuch a Preſentment is not traverſable, the party hath no remedy; 'tis contrary to the Opinion of</hi> Fitzherbert <hi>in Dyer,</hi>

                  <hi>it may be avoided by Plea, and this agrees with the ſecond Reſolution in</hi> Godfrey<hi>'s Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It was objected to the Plea, that it was not good, for it ſets forth, that the Plaintiff was amerced, and that it was affered at the Court, and ſo he hath confounded the Office of the Iurors and Affearers together, which he ought not to do, for he ſhould be amerced to a certain Sum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hob. 129. Rol. Abr. 542.</note> 
                  <hi>and not in general, which Sum may be mitigated or affered by others.</hi>

                  <hi>it need not be affered, becauſe that is impoſed by the Court; but this is an Amerciament which is the act of the Jury, and therefore it muſt be affered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The chiefeſt Exception was to the matter of the Warrant,</hi> viz. <hi>the Defendant ſets forth that he ſeiſed</hi> by virtue of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>from the Dean and Chapter; whereas he ought to ſhew it was directed to him from the Steward of the Court, and then to ſet forth the Warrant, without which he cannot juſtifie to diſtrain for an Amerciament.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>If it had been in Replevin where the Defendant made cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance in the right of the Lord, it might be well enough as here pleaded; but where 'tis to juſtifie by way of excuſe, there you muſt averr the Fact and alledge it to be done, and ſet forth the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it ſelf,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>THE Defendant was indicted for ſpeaking of ſcandalous words of Sir</hi> J.K. <hi>a Juſtice of the Peace.</hi> Viz. Sir <hi>J.K.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>for the Defendant ſaid that an Indictment would not lye for theſe words, becauſe not ſpoken to the Party in the exceution of his Office, but behind his back; it will not lye for irreverent words, but for Libels and Writings, becauſe ſuch are publick, but words are private offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Court being of Opinion that an Indictment would lye where an Action would not, becauſe it reſpects the publick Peace: and that an Action would not lye in this Caſe, unleſs the party had a particular loſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sid. 65. 2 Cio. 5 8.</note>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He then took Exceptions to the Form of the Indictment.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is</hi> no place of Abode <hi>laid where the Defendant did inhabit, which is expreſly required by the Statute of</hi> H. 5. Viz.

                  <note place="margin">2 Cro. 167.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Councel on the other ſide ſaid, that it was a new Doctrine, that the King ſhall not have the ſame Remedy by an Indictment which the Subject may have by an Action; What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words of all Commiſſions,</hi> de propalationibus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>As to the firſt Exception, they ſaid that the Indictment was certain enough, for the Defendant is laid to be</hi> de Almondbury <hi>in the Weſt-Riding of</hi> Yorkſhire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the ſecond Exception, they ſaid that</hi> ad pacem conſervand' <hi>without</hi> nunc <hi>is well enough, for it cannot be intended upon this Indictment that they were Iuſtices to preſerve the Peace in any other Kings Reign, and what was quoted out of</hi> Siderfin, <hi>is but the Opinion of one ſingle Iudge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is a Scandal upon the Government, and 'tis as much as to ſay that the King hath appointed an ignorant Man to be a Iuſtice of Peace, for which an Indictment will lye.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Writ of Error was brought to reverſe this Fine, and the Error aſſigned was, that the Cognizor died after the Caption, and before the Enrolment at the King's Silver Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued by the Councel for the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, that a Fine</hi> Sur Cognizance de droit, &amp;c. <hi>is ſaid to be levied when the Writ of Covenant is returned, and the Concord and King's Silver (which is an antient Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the Crown</hi> pro licencia concordandi) <hi>duly entred; for though the Cogniſor dieth afterwards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dyer 220. b. 5 Co. 37. Cro. Eliz. 469.</note> 
                  <hi>the Fine is good, and the Land paſſeth; but if the King's Silver be not entred, the Fine may be reverſed by Writ of Error; for it is an Action, and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the death of either Party abates it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it ſhould be objected that this cannot be aſſigned for Error, becauſe 'tis againſt the Record, which is</hi> Placita terrae irrotulat. de Termino Sanctae Trinitatis anno primo Jacobi, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, an Error cannot be aſſigned againſt the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Record, but in the matter of time it may, and ſo 'tis in this Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis like</hi> Syer's <hi>Caſe</hi> 32 Eliz.

                  <hi>who was indicted for a Burgla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuppoſed to be done</hi> primo Auguſti, <hi>and upon the Evidence it appeared to be done</hi> primo Septembris, <hi>and though he was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Indictment for that reaſon,</hi> viz. <hi>becauſe the Iudgment
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37883:82"/>relates to the day of the Indictment, yet it was reſolved by all the Iudges of</hi> England, <hi>that the very day needs not be ſet down in the Indictment; for be it before or after the Offence, the Iury ought to find according to the truth of the Caſe upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for they are ſworn</hi> ad veritatem dicendam, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This muſt be aſſigned for Error, for if the contrary be ſaid 'tis againſt the Record, the</hi> Cuſtos Brevium <hi>having retorned that the Fine was taken</hi> 30 July, <hi>which could not be in</hi> Trinity-<hi>Term, for that ended</hi> 8 July, <hi>otherwiſe 'tis repugnant to it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Econtra. <hi>It was argued, that this is not aſſignable for Error;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dyer 220. b. 12 Co. 124.</note> 
                  <hi>'tis true, if the Party had died before the Entry of the King's Silver, it had been Error, but if afterwards 'tis not ſo. Thus was the Caſe of</hi> Warnecomb <hi>and</hi> Carril, <hi>which was, Husband and Wife levied a Fine of the Lands of the Wife, and this was by</hi> Dedimus <hi>in the Lent Vacation, ſhe being then but</hi> 19 <hi>years of Age; the King's Silver was entred in</hi> Hillary-<hi>Term before, and ſhe died in the</hi> Eaſter-<hi>week; and upon a Motion made the firſt day of</hi> Eaſter-<hi>Term to ſtay the engroſſing of the Fine, it was denied by the Court, for they held it to be a good Fine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another reaſon why this is not aſſignable for Error,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cro. 11. Yelv. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>is becauſe 'tis directly againſt the Record, which is of</hi> Trinity-<hi>Term, and can be of no other Term; and to prove this he cited</hi> Arundel's <hi>Caſe, where a Writ of Error was brought to reverſe a Fine taken before</hi> Roger Manwood <hi>
                     <hi>Eſq;</hi> in his Circuit, he being then one of the Iuſtices of the</hi> Common-Pleas, <hi>and the</hi> Dedimus <hi>was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> per Rogerum Manwood Militem, <hi>for he was Knighted and made Chief Baron the Eerm following; the Fine paſſed and this was afterwards aſſigned for Trror, that he who took the Caption was not a Knight, but it being directly againſt the Record, they would not intend him to be the ſame perſon to whom the Writ was directed.</hi> Adjurnatur. <hi>Afterwards the Fine was affirmed.</hi>

<note place="margin">Verdict ſhall only be given in Evidence amongſt privies.</note> 
                  <hi>the Caſe was thus.</hi> Viz.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was objected at the Tryal, that ſhe had no power to make ſuch Settlement, becauſe in the year</hi> 1676. <hi>her Husband had ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37883:83"/>the Lands in queſtion upon her for Life, and upon the Iſſue of his Body,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and for want of ſuch Iſſue, then upon</hi> George Philpot <hi>in Tail Male, with ſeveral Remainders over, the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to</hi> Mary Philpot <hi>in Fee, Proviſo that upon the tender of a Guinea to</hi> George Philpot, <hi>by the ſaid</hi> Mary, <hi>the Limitations as to him ſhould be void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>George Philpot <hi>having afterwards made a Leaſe of this Land, to try the Title, the Truſtees brought an Ejectment; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the tender of the Guinea could not be proved, there was a Verdict for the Defendant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now Mr.</hi> Philpot <hi>would have given that Verdict in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at this Trial, but was not ſuffered by the Court, for if one Man hath a Title to ſeveral Lands, and if he ſhould bring E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectments againſt ſeveral Defendants, and recover againſt one, he ſhall not give that Verdict in Evidence againſt the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Party againſt whom that Verdict was had may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved againſt it, if 'tis not good, but the reſt cannot, tho' they claim under the ſame Title, and all make the ſame defence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So if two Tenants will defend a Title in Ejectment, and a Verdict ſhould be had againſt one of them, it ſhall not be read againſt the other, unleſs by Rule of Court.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But if an Anceſtor hath a Verdict, the Heir may give it in Evidence, becauſe he is privy to it; for he who produceth a Verdict muſt be either party or privy to it, and it ſhall never be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt different perſons, if it doth not appear that they are united in Intereſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore a Verdict againſt</hi> A. <hi>ſhall never be read againſt</hi> B. <hi>for it may happen that one did not make a good defence, which the other may do.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>AN Inquifition was taken in the ſecond year of this King, under the Great Seal of</hi> England, <hi>by which it was found that the Office of Marſhal of the</hi> Kings-Bench <hi>did concern the Adminiſtration of Iuſtice, and that Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>was ſeiſed thereof in Fee, and that upon his Marriage he had ſetled the ſaid Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon Sir</hi> Edward Norris <hi>and Mr.</hi> Coghill, <hi>and their Heirs in Truff that they ſhould permit him to execute the ſame during his Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſaid Truſtees had neglected to give their attendance, or to execute the ſaid Office themſelves, that this Canveyance was made by Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>without the notice of this Court; that he received the Profits, and afterwards granted the ſaid Office to</hi> Cooling <hi>for Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:37883:84"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> Croſs <hi>and his Wife had obtained a Iudgment in this Court againſt</hi> Bromley, <hi>and had ſued forth Erecution for the Debt and Damages, for which he was committed to the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the ſaid</hi> Cooling, <hi>and being ſo in Execution did go at large.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They find that</hi> Cooling <hi>had not ſufficient to anſwer</hi> Croſs <hi>and his Wiſe for the ſaid Debt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whereupon they impleaded Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>in the</hi> Common-Pleas, <hi>for</hi> 121 l. 2 s. 4 d. <hi>to anſwer as ſuperior; that at the Trial Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>gave this ſecret Deed of Settlement in Evidence, whereupon the Plaintiffs in that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were non-ſuited</hi> ad dampnum, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They find that</hi> Cooling <hi>went out of the ſaid Office, and the Truſtees neglecting the execution thereof, Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>granted the ſame to</hi> Glover <hi>for Life; that during the time he executed this Office, one</hi> Wordal <hi>was convicted of Forgery, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Cuſtody, and that he permitted him voluntarily to Eſcape, by which the ſaid Office was forfeited to the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King had granted the Office to the Lord</hi> Hunſdon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Edward Norris <hi>and Mr.</hi> Coghill <hi>come in and plead that Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee, and that he made a Settlement of the Office upon his Marriage with Mrs.</hi> Lucy Dunch (<hi>with whom he had</hi> 5000 l. <hi>Portion</hi>) viz. <hi>upon them and their Heirs in truſt,</hi> prout <hi>in the Inquiſition, and that he did execute the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by-their permiſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr</hi> Lenthal <hi>pleads and admits the Grant to Sir</hi> Edward Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris <hi>and the other Truſtee, bearing date ſuch a day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ſaith, that the next day afterwards,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> 10th <hi>day of</hi> Auguſt <hi>a Truſt of the ſaid Office was declared by another Deed,</hi> viz. <hi>to himſelf for Life, with Remainders over, and that by virtue thereof, and the conſent of the Truſtees, he took upon him the execution of the ſaid Office, and was thereof poſſeſſed either by himſelf or his Deputy, until the time of the Inquiſition taken; then he traverſed that the Eſcapes were voluntary (but did not anſwer the concealing of the Grant) and concludes,</hi> viz. per quod petit, <hi>that the King Hands may be amoved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Attorny General demurred to the Plea of the Truſtees, he likewiſe demurred to the Plea of Mr.</hi> Lenthal, <hi>and took iſſue that the Eſcapes were voluntary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued this Term and</hi> Trinity <hi>following, by Council on both ſides, and as to the matter of Law, they made theſe Points.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:37883:84"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That this Office cannot be granted in Truſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Eſcapes found in the Inquiſition, and not anſwered by the Truſtees, are ſufficient cauſes of Forfeiture of this Offce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Another Point was raiſed, whether the aſſignment of this Office to Truſtees (admitting it could be ſo granted) and their declaration of the Truſt, did create an Eſtate at will in Mr.</hi> Lenthal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it was a Tenancy at will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Then whether Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>had done any thing to determine his will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether he can by Law make a Deputy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether the aſſigning of this Truſt without giving notice thereof to this Court, be a Forfeiture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This Office cannot be granted in Truſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jones 128.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe 'tis a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Inheritance, and will not paſs by ſuch Conveyances as are uſed to convey Lands; ſo is my Lord of</hi> Oxford<hi>'s Caſe, in which it was held that a Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed of an Office, is void; neither can Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>take upon him the execution of this Office by the conſent of the Truſtees, for that cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Law ſhould be otherwiſe this inconvenience would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> viz. <hi>Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>might grant the Office to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave of the Court, and the Grantee might ſuffer voluntary Eſcapes, having no valuable Intereſt to anſwer the parties inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who muſt then ſue Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>and he hath no Eſtate in him, for he hath conveyed the Inheritance to the Truſtees, and if they ſhould be likewiſe ſued, no recovery could be againſt them, becauſe they are only nominal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis almoſt like the Grant of an Office of chief Prothonotary of the Court of</hi> Common-Pleas, <hi>to two perſons for Life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18 Ed. 4. f. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>which cannot be good, becauſe the Rolls of the Court cannot be in the keeping of two perſons at one time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It hath been adjudged that this very Office cannot be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for years,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Car. 587. Jones 437.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe 'tis an Office of Truſt and daily Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: and ſuch a termor for years may dye inteſtate, and then it would be in ſuſpence 'till Adminiſtration is committed, which is the act of another Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Point; That the Eſcapes found in the Inquiſition and the non-attendance of the Truſtees, are ſufficient cauſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, at the Common-Law Debt upon an Eſcape will not lie againſt the Goaler, that Action was afterwards given by the Statute of</hi> W. 2. <hi>For before that Act, the only remedy againſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37883:85"/>the Goaler was to bring an Action on the Caſe againſt him, founded upon a wrong done:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dyer 273.</note> 
                  <hi>But now Debt will lie, and if the party is not ſufficient at the time of the Eſcape,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Inſt. 382.</note> reſpondeat ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Marſhal who executes this Office, be it by right or wrong, is anſwerable to the King and his People for Eſcapes: If they are voluntary, 'tis a Forfeiture of his Office, nay, if a Deputy ſuffer ſuch Eſcapes, 'tis a Forfeiture by the Principal, unleſs ſuch Deputation be made for Life, and then the Grantee for Life only forfeits the Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the non-attendance of the Truſtees, if Mr.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">39 H. 6.32.</note> Lenthal <hi>be Tenant at will, and hath granted this Office to another for Life, this is a determination of the Tenancy at will, and a Forfeiture as to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now this Grantee for Life cannot be ſaid to be a Deputy, for ſuch a Grantee himſelf cannot make a Deputy, and therefore</hi> a fortiori, <hi>a Tenant at will cannot do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But admitting he ſhould be Deputy, yet a Forfeiture by him is a Forfeiture by his Superior; and therefore Mr.</hi> Lenthal<hi>'s te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy at will being gone, the Truſtees ought to attend, and their non-attendance ought to be a Forfeiture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The non-attendance of an Officer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Car. 491.</note> 
                  <hi>who was only a Searcher in a Port Town, was adjudged a Forfeiture; much greater is the Fault of that Officer who hath the adminiſtration of Iuſtice, if he do not give his attendance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">39 H. 6.34. a. 9 Co. 46. Dyer 198. Sid. 81. Dyer 150, 151.</note> 
                  <hi>if they do not attend, by conſequence they cannot act in the Office, and non-feazance is as ſufficient a cauſe of Forfeiture as any other miſ-behaviour whatſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if the Truſtees had given attendance, they are perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experient, and therefore incapable to execute this Office, for which they may be lawfully refuſed by this Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>chiefly inſiſted upon the point of Pleading, that the matter found by the Inquiſition was not anſwered by the Plea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, he excepted that the Defendant had not by his Plea en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled himſelf to any Eſtate in this Office,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Leon. 202. 2 Inſt. 695. Stamf. 62, 64. 2 Leon. 123.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore he could not traverſe the Title of the King, without making a Title to himſelf, for why ſhould he deſire that the Kings Hands may be amoved, and he reſtored to his Office, if he hath not ſhewen a Title to it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His pleading of this Deed of Truſt by which he is permitted to receive the Profits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>during Life cannot create ſuch an Eſtate in him, as will be executed by the Statute of Vſes; therefore
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37883:85"/>he can have no Eſtate for Life; for if a Man is ſeiſed in Fee of an Eſtate, and makes a Declaration thereof in Truſt for</hi> J. S. <hi>this is no colour to make an Eſtate for Life in</hi> J. S.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant hath therefore no more than a Truſt in this Office, which is nothing in the Eye of the Law, and for which there is no remedy but by</hi> Subpoena <hi>in</hi> Chancery, <hi>ſo that being only</hi> a Ceſtui que truſt, <hi>he hath neither</hi> jus in re, <hi>nor</hi> ad rem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He cannot be Tenant at will, for he is not made ſo by the Deed of Truſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a great deal of difference between Evidence and Pleading; for this very Deed may be an Evidence of an Eſtate at will, but 'tis not ſo in pleading; therefore he ought to have pleaded that</hi> coram praetextu <hi>he was poſſeſſed of the Office, and took the Profits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but he having otherwiſe pleaded, and not entituled himſelf to any Eſtate therein, he ought to be laid aſide as an incompetent perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plea of Sir</hi> Edward Norris <hi>is likewiſe inſufficient; for it ſets forth the Deed of Settlement,</hi> &amp;c. coram praetextu <hi>(the Defendant)</hi> juxta fiduciam in eo poſitam, <hi>was poſſeſſed of the Office</hi> ad eorum voluntatem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now an Office is a thing which lies in Grant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Leon. 219.</note> 
                  <hi>and cannot be transferred from one to another without Deed, and here is no Deed pleaded; and as no Eſtate at will can be granted of an Office without Deed, ſo likewiſe there cannot be a deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Offce without it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If then there can be no Tenant at Will of an Office, but by Deed, and no ſuch Deed is pleaded, then Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>had no power to make a Deputation to</hi> Cooling; <hi>but neither Tenant at will, nor Tenant for Life can make a Deputy, if in the very Grant made to them, there is not an expreſs Clauſe for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Office</hi> per ſe vel ſufficientem Deputatum ſuum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſubſtance of all which is,</hi> viz. <hi>Firſt, here is no Tenant at will: But admitting him to be ſo, he hath no authority to make a Deputy, and if he ſhould appoint a Deputy, he executes the Office without Authority, and may ſuffer Eſcapes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, by pleading of this Deed, he hath alledged that the Eſtate was in the Truſtees, and that they permitted him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Office</hi> coram praetextu, <hi>he did execute it, and receive the Profits; now this is too general, and an iſſue cannot be taken upon ſuch a Plea; he ſhould have pleaded poſitively, that it was demiſed to him at will, and that he made a Deputy; and then alſo the authority in</hi> rolls <hi>is againſt him, where 'tis held,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Rol. Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 chunk">
                        <desc>…</desc>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>that the Marſhal of the</hi> Kings-Bench <hi>may grant the Office for Life, but cannot give power to ſuch grantee to make a Deputy.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:37883:86"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if a Tenant for Life cannot make a Deputy, certainly a Tenant at will hath no power ſo to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſuppoſe a Deputy might be made, his neglect in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Office, ſhall make a Forfeiture of the Eſtate of the Grantee for Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be reaſonably objected in this Caſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rol. Abr. 155.</note> 
                  <hi>that 'tis any hardſhip for Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>to loſe this Office for any defect in Pleading; for admitting the Plea to be good; yet there is a cauſe of Forfeiture, becauſe the Marſhal of the</hi> King's Bench <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a miniſterial Officer, is required by Law to be a perſon of ſuch Ability as to anſwer all Eſcapes, that ſo Men may have the benefit of their Suits, for otherwiſe he having nothing to anſwer they may loſe their Debts. Now here by a ſecret Grant Mr.</hi> Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thal <hi>hath conveyed the Eſtate out of himſelf, and yet ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues Officer in poſſeſſion, by which means the People are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Remedy which the Law provides for them, and this is a ſufficient cauſe of Forfeiture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then as to the Truſtees, they have not ſaid any thing of the Eſcapes; 'tis true, Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>hath traverſed thoſe which are alledged to be voluntary, but that ſignifies nothing to them, becauſe they cannot take any benefit by the Plea of another, for every one muſt ſtand and fall by his own Plea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If therefore their non-attendance be a Forfeiture, the entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhall not help them, becauſe they come in without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Right.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
                  <hi>which was thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Viz. <hi>A Man ſeiſed of the Inheritance of the Office of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of this Court, conveys it in Truſt, the</hi> ceſtui que truſt <hi>enjoys it and receives the Profits; the Queſtion now is, whether the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attendance of the Truſtees, being never required by the Court, be a Forfeiture of this Office?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as incident to this Queſtion, it was debated whether Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>was Tenant at will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tis no Forfeiture, for they are not bound to attend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be denied but that this Office doth concern the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Iuſtice, but 'tis to be conſidered what Eſtate Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>hath in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He had once an Eſtate in Fee, but if it had been for Life or in Tail, it may be ſetled as this is done, but not for years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may then come to an Adminiſtrator.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:37883:86"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>be the</hi> ceſtui que uſe,
<note place="margin">Co. Lit. 404. Godb. 64.</note> 
                  <hi>then he hath an Eſtate of which the Law takes notice, for he may be a Iuror at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis plain that he hath an Eſtate created by operatian of the Law, for he is Tenant at Will, and for that reaſon the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Truſtees is not neceſſary; but if the Eſtate had been directly granted to them, then the Office had been forfeited for Non-attendance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be denied, but that this Office may be granted at Will, for ſo is Sir</hi> George Reynell's Caſe;
<note place="margin">9 Co. 98.</note> 
                  <hi>now if it may be granted at Will by the Poſſeſſor, it may likewiſe be ſo granted by him who hath an Eſtate created by the Law, for</hi> fortior eſt diſpoſitio legis quam hominis; <hi>and in this Caſe no Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency would happen; for if the Will be determined then the Grantor is the Officer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>had aſſigned this Office to the Truſtees, and they by a ſubſequent Deed had declared it to be in truſt for him, and that he ſhould take the Profits during life, he hath thereby a legal Eſtate at Will; for a</hi> Ceſtuy que Truſt <hi>by Deed is a Tenant at Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It hath been objected, that a Tenancy at Will of an Office is void, and to prove this a Caſe in</hi> Jones's Rep. <hi>was cited,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jones 128.</note> 
                  <hi>but the reaſon of that Caſe is guided by the particular nature of that Office which could not be aliened without the conſent of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this Office is not alienable in its nature then Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>hath ſtill the Fee-ſimple, but that will not be admitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is not only a bare Eſtate at Will, but a Truſt for Life, and ſuch a Truſt which hath a legal conſtruction;</hi>

                  <hi>for if a Feoffment be made in Truſt that he ſhould convey the Eſtate to another which the Feoffee afterwards refuſed to do, the</hi> Ceſtuy que Truſt <hi>may bring an Action againſt him; ſo if he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned on a Iury 'tis no Exception to ſay that he hath not</hi> liberum tenementum, <hi>and therefore he is not an incompetent perſon to have the charge of Priſons if he may be impannelled on a Iury to try men for their Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Then as to the firſt Queſtion upon the laſt point, whether Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>had done any thing to determine his Tenancy at Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Grant of this Office by him to</hi> Cooling <hi>will not amount to a determination of his Will, becauſe 'tis a void Grant.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, this is denied by my Lord</hi> Coke <hi>in his Comment upon</hi> Littleton,
<note place="margin">Sect. 71.</note> 
                  <hi>where he ſaith,</hi> If Tenant at Will grant over his Eſtate, and the Grantee entreth, he is a Diſſeiſor, for though the Grant be void, yet it amounts to a determination of his Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ground he had for ſuch an Opinion is not known; the Year Books quoted in the Margent will not warrant it, for they are in no ſort parallel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Caſe in the</hi> 27th <hi>of</hi> H.
<note place="margin">27 H. 6.3.</note> 6. <hi>is no more than Tenant at Will cannot grant over his Eſtate, becauſe he hath no certain or fixed Intereſt in it; and much to the ſame purpoſe is the Book of</hi> 22 E.
<note place="margin">22 E. 4.5.</note> 4. <hi>there cited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſuppoſe this to be a void Grant, and to amount to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Tenancy at Will, yet if the Truſtees had no notice of it, that ſhall not determine their Eſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Deviſe to an Executor that he ſhall have the overſight of the Teſtators Eſtate till his Daughter ſhould come of Age;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Yelv. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor made a Leaſe at Will rendring Rent; before the year expired the Daughter came of age, to whom the Tenant at Will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torned; the Executor brought an Action of Debt againſt him for the Rent arrear, it was held that this Attornment to the Daughter was no determination of his Will, for it would be of ill conſequence to the Leſſor if ſuch a Tenant ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Will a day or two before the end of the year, who had enjoyed all the Profits of the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether he may make a Deputy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, a judicial Officer cannot make a Deputy unleſs he hath a Clauſe in his Patent to enable him, becauſe his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is relied on in matters relating to his Office, which might be the reaſon of the making of the Grant to him; neither can a Miniſterial Officer depute one in his ſtead, if the Office be to be performed by him in perſon, but when nothing is required but a Superintendency in the Office he may make a Deputy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This appears more evident in the common Caſe of a Sheriff, who is an Officer made by the Kings Letters Patents, and 'tis not ſaid that he ſhall execute his Office</hi> per ſe vel ſufficientem De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatum ſuum,
<note place="margin">Roll. Rep. 274. 1 Leon. 146. 3 Leon. 99. Cro. Eliz. 173.</note> 
                  <hi>yet he may make a Deputy, which is the Vnder-Sheriff, againſt whom Actions may be brought by the Parties grieved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſuch a Deputy may be made without a Deed, for he claims no Intereſt in the Office but as a Servant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Eliz. 67. 10 Co. 192. a.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore where an Action on the Caſe was brought againſt the Deputy of a Sheriff for an Eſcape, who pleaded that the Sheriff made him
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37883:87"/>his Deputy to take Bail of Priſoners, and that he took Bond,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſhewed no Deed of Deputation, yet the Plea was held good upon a Demurrer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether the Aſſignment of this Truſt without giving notice to this Court be a Forfeiture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenant in Fee ſimple may do it, for he hath a power ſo to do by reaſon of the Dignity of his Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He who grants this Office without acquainting of this Court therewith muſt remain an Officer ſtill, and is ſubject to all Duties and Attendance till the Court hath notice of the Grant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is no occaſion of acquainting the Court in this Caſe, for upon the Grant made to the Truſtees by Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>he is ſtill the Officer though he hath not the ſame Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was objected that Sir</hi> Edward Norris, <hi>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath not ſaid any thing to the Eſcapes; but that doth neither concern Mr.</hi> Lenthal <hi>or the Truſtees;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cro. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>for if he be Tenant at Will they are not anſwerable for his neglect, for 'tis a perſonal</hi> Tort <hi>in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Tenant for years makes a Feoffment 'tis a Forfeiture of his Eſtate; but if he makes a Leaſe and Releaſe, though 'tis of the ſame operation, yet it will not amount to a Forfeiture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if any Eſcapes ſhould happen there is a plain remedy for the Parties agrieved; for if Tenant at Will remaineth in poſſeſſion of an Office, and ſuffers voluntary Eſcapes, his Office ſhall be ſeiſed into the Hands of this Court, then he in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion muſt make his Claim, and when that is done, he is an Officer</hi> nolens volens, <hi>and this was the Duke of</hi> Norfolk's Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now though theſe Eſcapes are found by the Inquiſition to be voluntary, yet they are anſwered in the Plea, for that part of the Inquiſition is traverſed, and that they were</hi> vi &amp; armis, <hi>and this being not yet tried the Court cannot give Iudgment thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If there be many negligent Eſcapes theſe ſhall not amount to a Forfeiture; as if a Rebel ſhould break Priſon or the Priſon ſhould be on Fire, thoſe are negligent, but the Officer ſhould not be ſo much as fined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if it ſhould be a Forfeiture the Neglect muſt be particularly alledged, for the Word</hi> Neglect <hi>is too general.</hi> Adjornatur.

               <p>

                     <hi>Auterfoits convict</hi> of Manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no good Plea in an Appeal for Murder.</note> 
                  <hi>brought by his Widow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant pleaded that he was indicted for the ſaid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Seſſions-houſe in the</hi> Old Bayly <hi>in</hi> Middleſex, <hi>that he was found guilty of</hi> Manſlaughter, <hi>and not of Murder,</hi> prout patet per Recordum, <hi>that he was</hi> Clericus &amp; paratus fuit legere ut Clericus, <hi>if the Court would have admitted him, and that he is the ſame perſon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this Plea the Appellant demurred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The truth of this Caſe was, that after the Conviction and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sentence an Appeal was brought, ſo that the Defendant had not an opportunity to pray his Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued by Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>for the Appellant, and by Sir</hi> George Treby <hi>for the Appellee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Statute of</hi> 3 H.
<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 1.</note> 7. <hi>was not in the way, this Plea might be a good Barr to the Appeal, becauſe before the making of that Law,</hi> Auterfoits convict, &amp;c. <hi>had been a good Plea, but now that Statute deprives the Defendant of that benefit; for 'tis enacted,</hi> That if any man be acquitted of Murder at the King's Suit, or the Principal <hi>attainted,</hi> the Wife or next Heir to him ſo ſlain, may take and have their Appeal of the Murder within a year and a day after the ſaid Murder done, againſt the ſaid perſons ſo acquitted or attainted if they be alive, and the Benefit of
<note place="margin">* <hi>Nota,</hi> At this time Clergy was allowed for Murder, but now taken away by the Statute of 23 H. 8. c. 1. Hales Pl. Cor. 232.</note> Clergy before not had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now though the Party be neither acquitted or attainted, but is only convicted of Manſlaughter, yet the word</hi> Attaint <hi>in this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſignifies the ſame with</hi> Convict, <hi>and this appears by the penning of the Act in that Clauſe which mentions the benefit of Clergy,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>That if any man be attainted of Murder the Heir ſhall have an Appeal if the benefit of Clergy be not had.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:37883:90"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now an</hi> Attainder <hi>ſuppoſeth a</hi> Conviction, <hi>for one is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the other, and if it ſhould not ſignifie the ſame thing in this place, then that Clauſe would be in vain, becauſe if it ſhould be taken for the Iudgment given upon the Conviction, then 'tis too late for the Party to have any benefit of his Clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus it was held in the ſecond Reſolution of</hi> Wrot <hi>and</hi> Wigg's Caſe <hi>that the word</hi> Attaint <hi>in this very Act ſhall not be intended only of a perſon, who hath Iudgment of Life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Co. 46. a.</note> 
                  <hi>but alſo of one</hi> Convict <hi>by Confeſſion or Verdict. 'Tis true,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Anderſ. 68.</note> 
                  <hi>'tis ſaid in that caſe and ſo likewiſe in</hi> Holecroft's Caſe <hi>that</hi> Auterfoits convict of Manſlaughter <hi>upon an Indictment of Murder is a good Bar to an Appeal at the Common Law, as well as if the Clergy had been allowed; the reaſon may be becauſe in both thoſe Caſes the Iudgments were by Confeſſion, ſo that the Court ought to have granted the Clergy; but this is a Conviction by Verdict which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>E contra. Auterfoits convict <hi>is a good Plea at the Common Law in all other Caſes (Treaſon only excepted) at this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>it appears by the Statute of</hi> H. 7. <hi>that the year and day which was the time allowed for the Appeal, and in which time the Kings Indictment could not be tried was an uſage, but not a Law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Act provides that the King ſhall proceed upon the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within the year and a day, and not ſtay for the Appeal of the Party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Party be attainted or acquitted, the Wife or next Heir ſhall have an Appeal, but not if he be convicted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now admitting that the word</hi> Attaint <hi>hath the ſame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication with the word</hi> Convict, <hi>yet this is a good Plea both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Words and the Equity of the Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This appears upon the Conſtruction of that Law, which muſt be expounded according to the vulgar Senſe and ſignification of the words, and therefore where the Statute ſaith,</hi> That an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal lies where the benefit of Clergy is not had (<hi>is that it is not had</hi> de Jure) <hi>but the Clergy in this Caſe was</hi> de Jure, <hi>and the Defendant was ready to read if he had been admitted thereunto by the Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus is the Statute of</hi> Malbridge <hi>about the taking away of Wards,</hi> viz. Si parentes conqueruntur, <hi>that is, if they had cauſe to complain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This Statute hath been expounded according to Equity, for though it gives an Appeal to the Wife or next Heir of</hi> him <hi>ſlain, yet if a Woman be killed, her next of Kin ſhall bring an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore by the ſame Equity theſe words,</hi> viz. (The benefit of Clergy not had) <hi>ſhall be conſtrued</hi> had <hi>by the Grant of the Court;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Co. Ent. 355.</note> 
                  <hi>for if a Man be indicted without the addition of Clerk, he cannot demand his Clergy unleſs the Court ask him; but if he be indicted with that addition then he may demand it, becauſe 'tis ſuppoſed by the Court that he can read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That this Appeal was not well brought theſe Exceptions were taken grounded upon the Statute of</hi> Glouceſter <hi>by which ſeven things are required in an Appeal of Murder.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6 E. 1. ca. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Appellor declare the Fact, the Year, the Day, the Hour, the Year of the King, the Town where the Fact was done, and with what Weapon the Party was ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now in this Caſe there is a defect in two of the things required by that Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That of the Hour which is laid too general, for 'tis</hi> circa horam octavam, <hi>which is not certain enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They have laid no Vill, for 'tis that the Defendant did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the Husband of the Appellant</hi> in Parochia Sancti Martini in Campis; <hi>now though that word</hi> Parochia <hi>has crept into Fines and Recoveries and likewiſe into Indictments, it muſt not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in Appeals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There may be ſeveral Vills in one Pariſh, and though this is ruled good in Indictments it ought not to be ſo here, becauſe of the difference between an Indictment and an Appeal;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stamf. 80. b. Doct. &amp; Stud. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>for in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments you need not mention the Hour, but it muſt be done in Appeals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Pariſh is an Eccleſiaſtical Diviſion, and though ſuch may be a Vill, 'tis not neceſſary</hi> Ex vi termini <hi>that it ſhould be ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But afterwards in</hi> Trinity-Term 4 Jac. <hi>the Chief Iuſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Opinion of all the Iudges (except Iuſtice</hi> Street) <hi>who were aſſembled for that purpoſe at</hi> Serjeants-Inn, <hi>that this was no good Plea, and that the Court ought not to ask the Priſoner what he had to ſay, and ſo to let him into the benefit of his Clergy:</hi> Tamen quaere, <hi>for 'tis otherwiſe reſolved.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That when the Defendant returned to</hi> Barbadoes, viz. 6 No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb. 35 Car. 2. <hi>he called a Council, before whom the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff was charged with</hi> male <hi>Adminiſtration in the abſence of the Defendant,</hi> viz. <hi>That he did not take the uſual Oath for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of Trade and Navigation; that he aſſumed the Title of Lieutenant Governour, and that Decrees made in Court were altered by him in his Chamber: Vpon which it was then ordered that he ſhould be committed to the Provoſt Marſhal, until diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by Law, which was done accordingly; in whoſe Cuſtody he remained from the</hi> 6th <hi>day of</hi> November <hi>to the</hi> 20th <hi>of</hi> Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>following which is the ſame Impriſonment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>It was ſaid for the Plaintiff, that the Cauſes of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment (if any) yet were ſuch which they ought not meddle withal, becauſe they relate to his Miſ-behaviour in his Government, for which he is anſwerable to the King alone.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then to alledge that he did alter in his Chamber ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees made in the Court of</hi> Chancery, <hi>that can be no cauſe of Commitment for the Governour is Chancellor there.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That the Court had power to commit him is not denied, for the King is not reſtrained by the Laws of</hi> England <hi>to govern that Iſland by any particular Law whatſoever, and therefore not by the Common Law, but by what Law he pleaſeth.</hi>

                  <hi>Vpon Not-Guilty pleaded there was a Verdict for the Plaintiff, and it was moved in arreſt of Iudgment, that the Plaintiff had not brought himſelf within the Preſcription, for he doth not

                  <hi>If one preſcribes to a Common, and doth not ſay for Cattle</hi> Levant <hi>and</hi> Couchant, <hi>the Preſcription is not good.</hi>

                  <hi>the Defendants plead that they were robbed, and ſuſpecting the Plaintiff to be guilty procured a Warrant in order to have the Plaintiff examined before a Iuſtice of the Peace, of which he had notice, and abſented himſelf, but was afterwards committed to the Gaol by a Iudge of this Court who adviſed them to preferr a Bill of Indictment,</hi> &amp;c. quae eſt eadem conſpiratio; <hi>this was adjudged a good Plea, though it amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no more than the general Iſſue, and all this matter might have been given in Evidence at the Trial.</hi>

                  <hi>THE Defendant was indicted at the Seſſions in</hi> London <hi>for not attending at the</hi> Wardmote Inqueſt <hi>being choſen of the Iury for ſuch a year.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>upon a</hi> Scire Fac. <hi>brought againſt the Plaintiff in the Errors, ſetting forth, that Debt was brought upon a Bond againſt</hi> Elizabeth Grey, <hi>and a Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was thereupon obtained for</hi> 800 l. dum ſola: <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Elizabeth <hi>afterwards intermarried with Mr.</hi> Obrian: <hi>That a</hi> Scire Facias <hi>was brought upon that Iudgment againſt Husband and Wife, to ſhew cauſe why the Plaintiff ſhould not have execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That upon this</hi> Scire Facias <hi>there were two</hi> Nichils <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and thereupon Iudgment was had againſt Husband and Wife. It reſted for a year and a day and, then the Wife died, and the Plaintiff brought a new</hi> Scire Fac. <hi>againſt the Husband alone, to ſhew cauſe why he ſhould not have Execution upon the firſt Iudgmont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant pleaded, that there was another</hi> Scire Fac. <hi>brought againſt him and his Wife for the ſame Cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And upon a Demurrer to this Plea, Iudgment was given in</hi> Ireland <hi>againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion now was, whether this</hi> Scire Fa. <hi>will lye againſt the Husband alone, after the death of his Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Caſe was argued by Mr.</hi> Finch <hi>and Mr.</hi> Pollexfen, <hi>that the Husband was not chargable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was admitted on all ſides, that if a Feme ſole is indebted and marries, that an Action will lye againſt the Husband and Wife, and he is lyable to the payment of her Debts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was agreed alſo, that if a Iudgment be had againſt a Feme ſole, and ſhe marries, and afterwards dies, that the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is not chargable, becauſe her Debts before Coverture ſhall not charge him, unleſs recovered in her Life-time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In like manner no Debts which are due to her</hi> dum ſola, <hi>ſhall go to the Husband by virtue of the inter-marriage, if ſhe dye before thoſe are recovered,; but her Adminiſtrator will be entituled to them, which may be the Husband, but then he hath a Right only as Adminiſtrator,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Roll Abr. 351.</note> 
                  <hi>and the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch Debts before they are recoverd are only</hi> choſes in Action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And from hence the Council did inferr, that the Iudgment in this Caſe againſt the Wife,</hi> dum ſola, <hi>did not charge the Husband.</hi>

               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:37883:106"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Queſtion will be, if the Husband is not chargeable by the Original Iudgment, whether the Iudgment on the</hi> Scire Fac. <hi>had not made an alteration, and charged him after the death of his Wife?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as to that, it was ſaid that this Iudgment upon the</hi> Scire Fac. <hi>made no new charge, for 'tis only</hi> quod habeat exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutionem, &amp;c. <hi>and carries the firſt Iudgment no farther than it was before, for 'tis introduced by the</hi> Sci. Fac.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the Common Law no Execution could be had upon a Iudgment after a year and a day; and there was then no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but to bring an Action of Debt upon that Iudgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Inconvenience was remedied by the Statute of</hi> Weſtm.
<note place="margin">W. 2. cap. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>the</hi> 2. <hi>which gives a</hi> Scire Fac. <hi>upon the Iudgment, to ſhew cauſe why Execution ſhould not be had, which can be no more than a liberty to take Execution upon the Original Iudgment, which cannot charge the Husband in this caſe, becauſe 'tis only a conſequence of that Iudgment, and creates no new charge, for a Releaſe of all Actions will diſcharge this award of Execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Reaſons why the original Iudgment ſhall not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried farther by the Iudgment in the</hi> Scire Fac. <hi>are as follow.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon which words it is evident, that the execution of the firſt Iudgment on Record is all which is given by this Act af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the year and day, and it takes off that bar which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred by the lapſe of time, and gives a ſpeedy Execution of the Iudgment recorded.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Proceedings upon a</hi> Scire Facias <hi>ſhew the ſame thing, for the Writ recites the firſt Iudgment, and then demands the Defendant to ſhew cauſe why the Plaintiff ſhould not have Execution thereon</hi> juxta vim formam &amp; effectum recuperationis praed. <hi>but prays no new thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A</hi> Scire Facias <hi>is not an Original but a Iudicial Writ, which depends purely upon the firſt Iudgment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Roll. Abr. 777. pl. 6. 8 Co. 143 Dr. <hi>Drurie</hi>'s Caſe.</note> 
                  <hi>and a Writ of Error ſuſpends the execution of both; ſo likewiſe if the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Iudgment be reverſed, even a Iudgment obtained upon a</hi> Scire Facias, <hi>will be reverſed in like manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Law doth not charge a Man without an Appearance, but here is none; and the Statute can never operate upon this Caſe, becauſe that extends only to ſuch Iudgments upon which there has been a Recovery; and here is nothing reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

                  <hi>If the Law ſhould be otherwiſe, this abſurdity would follow,</hi> Viz. <hi>There would be a Recovery without a Record; for the purport of the</hi> Scire Facias <hi>is only to have Execution according to the form and effect of the Record, and the very Record it ſelf doth not charge the Husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, the firſt Iudgment did charge the Lands of the Wife, which are ſtill liable to ſatisfie the Debt; why therefore muſt the Lands of the Husband be charged? Cannot the Adminiſtrator of the Wife bring a Writ of Error to reverſe this Iudgment? and if it ſhould be reverſed, ſhall the Husband pay the Debt, and the Adminiſtrator of the Wife be reſtored?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Objections made by the Council on the other ſide againſt this Opinion were,</hi> viz. <hi>That if an Action of Debt will lie upon a Iudgment in a</hi> Scire Facias, <hi>the Original Iudgment is by this means carried farther, for without a new Recovery Debt will not lie;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">F.N.B. 122. E.</note> 
                  <hi>and to prove this there is and Authority in</hi> Fitzherbert, <hi>where a</hi> Prior <hi>had Iudgment for an Annuity, and brought a</hi> Scire Fac. <hi>upon that Iudgment, againſt the Succeſſor of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was to pay it, and obtained a Iudgment upon that</hi> Scire Fac. <hi>to recover the arrearages, and afterwards brought an Action of Debt upon the laſt Iudgment, and the Book ſays</hi> fuit maintein.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt, As to the Caſe in</hi> Fitzherbert, <hi>'tis admitted to be Law, but 'tis not an Authority to be objected to this purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt Iudgment for the Annuity charges the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; but the Original Iudgment in this Caſe doth not charge the Husband, ſo the Caſes are not parallel.</hi>

                  <hi>The like anſwer may be given to the Caſe in</hi> Leonard, <hi>for a Recognizance is a Iudgment in it ſelf, and Debt will lie upon it without a</hi> Sci. Fa. <hi>upon that Iudgment.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be denied but that if a Woman be indebted and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, the Husband is chargable during the Coverture,</hi>

                  <hi>As to the</hi> Sci. Fa. <hi>tis true, at the Common Law, if a Man had recovered in Debt, and did not ſue forth Execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year and a day, he muſt then bring a new Original,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant after an Imparlance pleads that at the time of the Converſion he was a Servant to King</hi> Charles <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and a Captain of a Man of War called the</hi> Phoenix, <hi>and that he did ſeize the ſaid Ship for the Governour of the</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Company, ſhe going in a trading Voiage to the</hi> Indies <hi>contrary to the King's Prohibition,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And for the King it was argued, that this Claim was not good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt as to the manner of the Grant as 'tis here pleaded,</hi> viz. <hi>that the King was ſeized in Fee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that he granted the</hi> Franchiſe <hi>Habendum</hi> the ſaid Hundred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſuch a Grant can never include the Hundred, for nothing can paſs in the</hi> Habendum, <hi>but what was mentioned in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Defendant hath derived a Title from the Crown to this Office of a Bayliff, which muſt be either by Grant or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi>

               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:37883:113"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be by Grant, for 'tis a Queſtion whether the Hundred Court can now be ſeparated from the County Court; it hath been derivative from it in former times when the Sheriffs did let thoſe Hundreds to farm to ſeveral perſons who put in Bayliffs errant to the great oppreſſion of the People, which was the occaſion of the making of the Statute of</hi> Ed.
<note place="margin">14 E. 3. c. 9.</note> 3. <hi>by which ſuch Hundreds were united and rejoyned to the Counties, as to the Bailiwicks thereof,</hi>

                  <hi>except ſuch as were then granted in Fee by the King or his Anceſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now theſe Hundreds were uſually granted to Abbots and other religious perſons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>and their Poſſeſſions coming afterwards to the King by the diſſolution of their Abbies and Monaſteries are now merged in the Crown, and cannot be regranted after the making of that Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as the Defendnat cannot have a Title by Grant, ſo he hath not preſcribed to have this Office; 'tis true, the Plea ſets forth that 'tis an ancient Office, but that is not a Preſcription but a bare Averment of its Antiquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But admitting he had alledged it by way of</hi> Preſcription,
<note place="margin">14 H. 4.89.</note>

                  <hi>A man cannot preſerive to have Cognizance of Pleas in an Hundred Court, he may in a County Palatine, becauſe 'tis of a mixed Iuriſdiction.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was never yet denied, but that the King may be ſeized in Fee of an Hundred, and that he may grant</hi> Retorna Brevium; <hi>the Statutes are plain in it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 E. 3. c. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>for otherwiſe how came any Lords to have Hundreds in Fee, but by the Kings Grants?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And 'tis as plain that Hundreds may be divided from the County;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 E. 3. c. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>for elſe to what purpoſe was the Statute of</hi> Lincoln <hi>made, which adjoins Hundreds and Wapentakes to the Counties, and provides that they ſhall never be ſeparated again, this ſhews that they were divided at that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Objections which have been made are,</hi> viz. <hi>That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant cannot have a Title to this Office by Grant, and he hath not made any Preſcription to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Reaſons given why he could not have it by Grant were, becauſe ancient Hundreds which were united to the Counties by the Statute of</hi> Ed. 3. <hi>could never afterwards be divided from them by any Grant of the King, and thoſe which were excepted in that Statute, as being granted in Fee by the King or his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:37883:113"/>Anceſtors, when they come again to the Crown cannot be regrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they are merged in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In anſwer to which it was ſaid that ſuch ancient Liberties, which were created by the Crown and did ſubſiſt by the King's Grant before the Statute of</hi> Ed. 3. <hi>when afterwards they came to the King were not merged, but remained a diſtinct Intereſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Hundred of</hi> Gartree <hi>in the County of</hi> Leiceſter <hi>was ſuch a Liberty; it was an ancient Hundred and granted by</hi> Ed. 2.
<note place="margin">Cole <hi>verſus</hi> Ireland. Raym. 360.</note> 
                  <hi>to</hi> John Sedington, <hi>not in Fee, but</hi> durante bene placito Regis; <hi>this Grant was long before the making of the Statute of</hi> Ed. 3. <hi>and yet afterwards this very Hundred was granted to ſeveral other perſons by the ſuceeding Kings of</hi> England, <hi>which ſhews it was merged in the Crown, when it came to the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other Objection was, that</hi> Retorna Brevium <hi>doth not lie in Preſcription.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now as to that, though it be true, that no Title by Preſcription can be made to ſuch Franchiſes and Liberties which cannot be ſeized as forfeited before the cauſe of Forfeiture appears on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, becauſe Preſcription being an Vſage</hi> in pais <hi>doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſuch things which cannot be had without matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Inſt. 114. b.</note> 
                  <hi>Yet my Lord</hi> Coke <hi>is clear that a good Title may be made to hold Pleas, Leets, Hundreds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by Preſcripteon only without Matter of Record.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>THE Defendant was convicted of</hi> Manſlaughter <hi>at the</hi> Old-Bayly,

                  <hi>But being once convicted the Dean and Chapter of</hi> Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>did ſeize his Goods as forfeited by that Conviction, who thereupon (although he was out of the Court by that Iudgment) yet he moved by his Council to quaſh the Indictment.</hi>

                  <hi>That there was no Preſident to warrant ſuch an Indictment, for this may be the Preſentment of another Iury; it being very incoherent to ſay that it was preſented by the Oaths of twelve Men, that the Iury do preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ought to be</hi> praeſentat' exiſtit quod, &amp;c. <hi>and ſo is the form of this Court, as the Clerk of the Crown inform'd them.</hi>

               <p>Vaux<hi>'s Indictment for Poiſoning</hi> Ridley <hi>was,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the reaſon is plain, for an Indictment for Felony being a Declaration for the King againſt the Life of a Subject, ought to ſet forth a ſufficient certainty of the Fact, which ſhall not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied either by Argument, or any intendment whatſoever.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion upon this ſpecial Verdict was, whether the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this laſt Will was a</hi> revocation <hi>of the former or not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued this Term by Mr.</hi> Finch, <hi>and in</hi> Michaelmas-<hi>Term following by Serjeant</hi> Maynard <hi>for the Plaintiff, that it was not a revocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In their Arguments it was admitted that a Will in it's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was revocable at all times, but then it muſt be either by an expreſs or implied revocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the making of this latter Will cannot be intended to be an implied revocation of the former; for if ſo, then the Land muſt alſo be ſuppoſed to be deviſed contrary to the expreſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the firſt Will, and that would be to add to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which finds,</hi> Viz. <hi>that what the laſt Will was</hi> penitus ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is poſſible that a ſubſequent Will may be made ſo as not to deſtroy but conſiſt with a former; for the Teſtator may have ſeveral parcels of Land, which he may deviſe to many perſons by divers Wills, and yet all ſtand together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A man may likewiſe by a ſubſequent Will revoke part and confirm the other part of a former Will; and therefore admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there was ſuch a Will in this caſe, 'tis ſtill more natural that it ſhould confirm than revoke the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Teſtator had purchaſed new Lands, and had deviſed the ſame by a ſubſequent Will, no perſon will affirm that to be a revocation of the former Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When a Man hath made a diſpoſition of any part of his Eſtate, 'tis a good Will as to that part; ſo is likewiſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of every other part; they are all ſeveral Wills, tho' ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken altogether, they are an intire diſpoſition of the whole Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nothing appears here to the contrary, but that the latter Will may be only a deviſe of his perſonal Eſtate, or a confirmation of the former, which the Law will not allow to be deſtroyed without an expreſs revocation.</hi>

                  <hi>and deviſes the Lands to his eldeſt Son for Life, and to the Heirs Males of his Body, and for default of ſuch Iſſue to the Heirs Males of his ſecond Son, and the Heirs Males of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Remainder to his own right Heirs, and then made a Leaſe of</hi> 30 <hi>years to his youngeſt Son, to commence after the death of the Teſtator: the youngeſt Son entred and ſurrendred the Term to his elder Brother, who made a Leaſe to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and then dyed without Iſſue; afterwards the youngeſt Brother entred and avoided this Leaſe made by his Brother. It was held that the Leaſe thus made to him was not a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the deviſe of the Inheritance to his Brother, tho' it was to commence at the ſame time in which the deviſe of the Inheritance was to take effect, but it was a revocation</hi> quoad <hi>the Term only, that the elder Brother ſhould not enter during that time, for the deviſe ſhall not be revoked without expreſs words; and that tho' the Teſtator had departed with the whole Fee without reſerving an Eſtate for Life to himſelf, yet the Law created ſuch an Eſtate in him, till the future Vſe ſhould commence; and in ſuch caſe the right Heirs cannot take by Purchaſe but by Deſcent; ſo that here the Inheritance in Fee ſimple was not veſted in the elder Brother by Deſcent, for then the Leaſe which he made would be executed out of the Feé and the younger Brother would be bound thereby.</hi>

               <p>

<note place="margin">2 R. 3. f. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>comes not up to this queſtion, it was an Action of Treſpaſs for the taking of his Goods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant pleaded that the Goods did appertain to one</hi> Robert Strong, <hi>who before the ſuppoſed Treſpaſs deviſed the ſame to him, and made him Executor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff replied, that the ſaid</hi> Strong <hi>made his laſt Will, and did conſtitute him Executor.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:37883:116"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And upon a Demurrer to this Replication, becauſe he had not traverſed that the Defendant was Executor, it was argued for the Plaintiff, that this laſt Will was a Revocation of the former, for tho' there were no expreſs words of Revocation, yet by the very making another the Law revoked the former; and to prove this, two Inſtances were then given,</hi> viz. <hi>That if a Man deviſe his Lands to two, and by another Will gives it to one of them and dies, he to whom 'tis deviſed by the laſt Will ſhall have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So likewiſe, if the Teſtator by one Will giveth Lands to his Son, and by another Will deviſeth the ſame again to his Wife, then makes an Alienation, and taketh back an Eſtate to himſelf, and dieth; and in an Aſſiſe brought between the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and the Son, he was compelled by the Court to ſhew that it was his Father's intention that he ſhould have the Land, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the laſt Deviſee will be entituled to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now both theſe Inſtances are not ſufficient to evince that the laſt Will in this Caſe was a revocation of that under which the Plaintiff claims, becauſe thoſe Wills were contradictory to each other; for by one the Land was deviſed to the Son, and by the other to the Wife, they both had their exiſtence at one and the ſame time, and it appear'd they were made to diſtinct purpoſes, but here no body can tell what was deſigned or intended by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator in this ſubſequent Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore it hath been held,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Car. 51. <hi>Eyres</hi> Caſe. Godolph. 443. Perkins 92. b.</note> 
                  <hi>that where a Man deviſed Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies to his two Brothers, and afterwards in his ſickneſs was asked to leave Legacies to his ſaid Brothers, he replied he would leave them nothing, but deviſed a ſmall Legacy to his Godſon, and died. This Diſcourſe was ſet down in a Cocidil, which, together with the Will was proved in common form: This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicil was not a revocation of the Legacies given to the Brothers, becauſe the Teſtator took no notice of the Will which he had made in the time of his Health, and</hi> non conſtat <hi>what he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe words which were ſet down in the Codicil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If therefore doubtful words ſhall not make a revocation of a former Will,</hi> a fortiori, <hi>a ſubſequent Will, eſpecially when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of ſuch Will doe not appear, ſhall not revoke a former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued for the Defendant.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
                  <hi>And</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The only Objection is, That a latter Will being made, and it not appearing to the Iury what was contained in that Will, it can be no revocation, becauſe no expreſs words of revocation can be found, or any thing which is contradictory to the firſt
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37883:116"/>Will, and without the one or the other, a former Will cannot be revoked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is contrary to all the Authorities in the Books,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Linwood 175. Swinb. 7 part, Sect. 14. 2 H. 5.8. pl. 3. Offiice of Ex. 443.</note> 
                  <hi>which ſhew that a Teſtament which is good in the beginning may become void by making of a ſubſequent Will, by words of revocation, or by words contradicting each other; for in ſuch caſes 'tis not doubted but the firſt Will is revoked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the meaning muſt be, that by the very making of a lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Will the firſt is become void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This may be collected from the nature of a Will, which a Man hath power to alter in part or in all, at any time during his Life; but when he makes a new Will, it muſt be preſumed that he declared his whole mind in it; for if his Intentions are to alter any part, the Law hath appointed a proper Inſtrument for that purpoſe, which is a Codicil; but when he maketh</hi> aliud Teſtamentutum, <hi>'tis a ſign that he intended nothing of his former Will ſhould take any effect, when he had ſo eaſie a method to alter it in part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every ſubſequent act of the Teſtator ſhews that he intends a revocation, either by word or deed; and there is great reaſon why it ſhould be ſo, becauſe every revocation of a Will is in the nature of reſtitution to the Heir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be denied but that a Will may be revoked by words without writing, before the making of the Statute againſt Frauds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Rol. Abr. 614. Dyer 310. b.</note> &amp;c. <hi>As if a Man ſhould ſay that he would alter his Will when he came to ſuch a place, and he ſhould dye before he came thither, this is a revocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it never was yet controverted but a revocation may be by Deed; as if a Man deviſe Lands to another,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Rol. Abr. 614.</note> 
                  <hi>and afterwards makes a Feoffment to the uſe of his Will, this was always held a revocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So it is if Lands which are well given by a Will are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by another Will deviſed to the Poor of the Pariſh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Rol. Abr. 614. <hi>pl.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>tho' this laſt Will is void, becauſe the Deviſees have not a capacity to take, yet 'tis a revocation of the firſt Will; and ſhall a Will which is loſt be of leſs authority than ſuch which is void?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis not denied but that there may be a ſubſequent Will which may not contradict the firſt; ſo is</hi> Coward<hi>'s Caſe, where both Wills did appear to be conſiſtent; but that is not paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with this, becauſe the Iury hath found that the Teſtator made</hi> aliud Teſtamentum, <hi>which word</hi> aliud <hi>imports a diſtinct Will from the former.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis agreed alſo, that a Man may make many Wills, and that they may ſtand together; and it muſt alſo be agreed that ſuch are but partial Wills, becauſe they are but pieces of the whole, tho' written in ſeveral papers; but when 'tis found in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that</hi> aliud Teſtamentum <hi>was made, it muſt naturally be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of his whole Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Caſe in the Year Book of</hi> Richard III. <hi>is an Authority in point, where in Treſpaſs the Defendant juſtified the taking of the Goods by vertue of a Will by which they were deviſed to him, and of which Will he was made Executor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff replied, that the Teſtator made another Will, and thereby did conſtitute him Executor; and this was held a good Replication without a Traverſe that the Defendant was Executor, becauſe by the making of the ſecond Will the other was void in Law; and therefore the ſhewing that he was Executor was not to avoid the firſt Will (which the Law doth adjudge to be of no force) but to make to himſelf a Title to the Goods taken out of his poſſeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If a Man ſhould make twenty Codicils without dates, they may all ſtand together; but if he make two Wills without dates they are both void; the reaſon is becauſe by the making of the later Will the firſt is deſtroyed; and it being incertain which is the laſt, rather than the Rules of Revocation ſhould be broken they adjudge both to be void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be reaſonably objected, that this later Will may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the ſame Lands to the ſame perſon; for why ſhould a Man be thought ſo vain? Beſides if it was ſo, the Plaintiff ſhould have claimed under that Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this cannot be the ſame Will, becauſe 'tis contrary to the Verdict which hath not found it to be</hi> idem, <hi>but</hi> aliud Teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; <hi>beſides 'tis in the Caſe of an Heir who ſhall not be diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited by an intendment that the later Will is the ſame with the firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither can the Statute of Wills have any influence upon this Matter.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 1. 34 H. 8. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>'Tis true, at the Common Law no Land could be deviſed by a Will, but now by the Statutes of</hi> H. 8. <hi>Lands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in Socage may be deviſed by Will; and if held in Knights Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then only two parts in three,</hi>

                  <hi>but it muſt be by the laſt Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now how can any Man ſay that this ſhall be a Deviſe of the Lands by the laſt Will of the Teſtator, when the Iury find he made</hi> aliud Teſtamentum; <hi>the Contents whereof are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſhewed, becauſe the Defendant claims as Heir, and not as Executor.</hi>

               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:37883:117"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>It muſt not be intended that this Will ſhall confirm or ſtand with the other, becauſe the Law is otherwiſe; and therefore if the Plaintiff would have ſupported his Will by which he claims, he ought to ſhew the other Will, by which it muſt appear that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is contradictory to it, or that it doth confirm the firſt; but if Preſumptions ſhall be admitted it muſt be in favour of the Heir, for nothing ſhall be preſumed to diſinherit him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Afterwards he made a</hi> Codicil <hi>in theſe words,</hi> viz.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Appleton <hi>argued that it would not, becauſe the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had only a bare Authority to let it or improve it for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Children, there was no Deviſe of the Land to them.</hi>

                  <hi>If Power be given to Executors to ſell Lands, 'tis only an Authority and not an Intereſt in them; but a bare Authority only to let is of much leſs importance.</hi>

               <head>The Biſhop<hi>'s Caſe.</hi> Friday, June 15th.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE King having ſet forth a</hi> Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, <hi>did on the</hi> 4th <hi>day of</hi> May <hi>laſt by Order of Council enjoyn that the ſame ſhould be read twice in all Churches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that the Biſhops ſhould diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it through their reſpective Dioceſſes that it might be read ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>(who then was) together with ſix other Biſhops petitioned the King, ſetting forth that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was founded upon a diſpenſing Power, which had been declared illegal in Parliament, and therefore they could not in Honour or Conſcience make themſelves Parties to the Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Publication of this Declaration, who thereupon were ſummoned before the King in Council, and refuſing there to give Recognizance to appear before the Court of</hi> Kings Bench, <hi>they were committed to the Tower by Warrant of the Council-Board.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Attorney General moved for a</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>retornable</hi> immediate, <hi>and the ſame Morning in which that Motion was made Sir</hi> Edward Hales <hi>Lieutenant of the Tower returned the ſame, and they were all brought into the Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:37883:119"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Subſtance of the Return was,</hi> viz. <hi>That they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Cuſtody by Warrant under the Hands and Seals of the Lord Chanchellor</hi> Jefferies, <hi>and alſo naming more of the Lords of the Privy-Council,</hi> Dominos Concilij, <hi>for contriving, making and publiſhing a Seditious Libel againſt the King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then it was prayed that the Return might be filed, and that the Information which was then exhibited againſt them for this Crime might be read, and that they might all plead</hi> inſtanter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serjeant</hi> Pemberton, <hi>Mr.</hi> Finch <hi>and Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>oppſed the reading of it, and moved that the Biſhops might be diſcharged, becauſe they were not legally before the Court; for it appears upon the Return that there is no lawful cauſe of Commitment, and that for two reaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe the perſons committing had not any Authority ſo to do; for upon the Return it appears that they were committed by ſeveral Lords</hi> of <hi>the Council, whereas it ſhould have been by ſo many Lords</hi> in <hi>Council, or by Order of Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They ought not to be committed for this Fact, which is only a Miſdemeanour. The Biſhops are Peers, and therefore the Proceſs ought to be a Summons by way of</hi> Subpoena <hi>out of the Crown Office, and not to commit them the firſt time. If a Man comes in voluntarily he cannot be charged with an Information; neither can a perſon, who is found in Court by any Proceſs be ſo charged if it be illegal, as if a Peer be committed by</hi> Capias.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtice</hi> Allybon <hi>replyed, that when a Commitment was made by the Lord Chief Iuſtice of this Court his Name is to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but not his Office; 'tis not ſaid</hi> Committitur per Capitalem Juſticiarium Angliae &amp;c. <hi>for he is known to be ſo; and why ſhould not a Commitment by ſuch perſons</hi> Dominos Concilij <hi>be as good as a Commitment by Sir</hi> Rob. Wright Capitalem Juſticiarium? <hi>That it was enough for the Officer to return his Warrant, and when that is done the Court will preſume that the Commitment was by the Power which the Lords in Council had, and not by that Power which they had not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which it was anſwered by Mr.</hi> Finch, <hi>that the Lord Chief Iuſtice always carries an Authority with him to commit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goes in</hi> England; <hi>but the Lords of the Privy Council have not ſo large a Power; for though they be Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil always, yet they do not always act in Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:37883:120"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Statute of</hi> 17 Car. 1. cap. 10. <hi>was read, in which there is mention made of a Commitment by the Lords of the Privy Concil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it was anſwered that that Statute was to relieve againſt illegal Commitments, and thoſe enumerated in that Act were ſuch only, and none elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it was ſtrongly inſiſted, that Peers of the Realm cannot be committed at the firſt inſtance for a Misdemeanour before Iudgment; and that no Preſident can be ſhewed where a Peer hath been brought in by</hi> Capias, <hi>which is the firſt Proceſs for a bare Misdemeanour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The conſtant Proceedings in the</hi> Starr-Chamber <hi>upon ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations were,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Crompt. Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction 33. Dyer 315. 4 Inſt. 25. Regiſt. 287.</note> viz. <hi>Firſt the Lord Chancellor ſent a Letter to the perſon, then if he did not appear, an Attachment went forth;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kings Council anſwered,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Baptiſt Hick's <hi>Caſe.</hi> Hob.</note> 
                  <hi>that a Peer may be committed for the Breach of the Peace, for which Sureties are to be given, and can there be any greater Breach of the Peace than a Libel againſt the King and Government? 'Tis certainly ſuch a Breach of the Peace for which Sureties ought to be demanded; for where there is any ſeditious Act there muſt be a Breach of the Peace, and if Sureties are not given then the perſon muſt be committed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Objections were over-ruled by three Iudges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Information was read, which in Subſtance was,</hi> viz. <hi>That the King by vertue of his Prerogative did on the</hi> 4th <hi>day of</hi> April <hi>in the third year of his Reign publiſh his gracious Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Liberty of Conſcience, which was ſet forth</hi> in haec verba.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That afterwards,</hi> viz. 27 Aprilis <hi>in the fourth year of his Reign, the King did publiſh another Declaration reciting the former in which he expreſſed his care that the Indulgence by him granted might be preſerved,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that he cauſed this laſt Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be printed; and to manifeſt his favour more ſignally towards his Subjects, on the</hi> 4th <hi>day of</hi> May, 1688. <hi>it was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Council that his Declaration dated the</hi> 27th <hi>day of</hi> April <hi>laſt, be read on two ſeveral days in all Churches and Chappels in the Kingdom, and that the Biſhops cauſe the ſame to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through their ſeveral Dioceſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That after the making of the ſaid Order,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Biſhops (naming them) did</hi> conſult and conſpire <hi>amongſt themſelves to leſſen the Authority and Prerogative of the King, and to elude the ſaid Order; and in further proſecution of their ſaid Conſpiracy they with Force and Arms did on the</hi> 18th <hi>day of</hi> May, &amp;c. <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:37883:120"/>maliciouſly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>frame, compoſe and write a Libel of the King, ſubſcribed by them, which they cauſed to be publiſhed under the pretence of a Petition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Petition was ſet forth</hi> in haec verba,</p>
               <p>In contemptum dicti Domini Regis, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King's Council moved that the Defendants might plead</hi> inſtanter, <hi>for ſo (they ſaid) is the courſe of the Court when a Man is brought thither in Cuſtody, or appears upon Recognizance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Council on the other ſide prayed an Imparlance and a Copy of the Information, and argued that the Defendants ought not to plead</hi> inſtanter, <hi>becauſe their Plea ought to be put in Writing, and that they ought to have time to conſider what to plead; that it was impoſſible to make any Defence when they did not know the Accuſation, and that the Practice of the Court an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently was with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, when a</hi> Subpoena <hi>is taken out, and the Party doth not appear but is brought in by</hi> Capias, <hi>he ſhall plead</hi> inſtanter; <hi>and the reaſon is, becauſe he hath given delay to the Cauſe: So 'tis likewiſe in Caſes of Felony or Treaſon, but not to an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for a Misdemeanour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Clerk of the Crown informed the Court that it was the Courſe to plead</hi> inſtanter <hi>in theſe following Caſes,</hi> viz. <hi>when the perſon appears upon a Recognizance, or</hi> in propria per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona, <hi>or is a Priſoner in Cuſtody upon any Information for a Misdemeanour where no Proceſs iſſued out to call him in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Objection that the Defendants cannot make any Defence without a Copy of the Information; the Vſage is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe even in Caſes where a Man's Life is concerned, and what greater difficulty can there be to defend an Accuſation for a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour than a Charge for High-Treaſon? certainiy the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants all know whether they are innocent or not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe Points being over-ruled by the Court, the Archbiſhop of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Plea in writing, the Subſtance of which was, that they (naming all the Defendants) were Peers of Parliament, and ought not to be compelled to anſwer this Misdemeanour imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but they ought to appear upon due Proceſs of Law, and upon their Appearance to have a Copy of the Information, and afterwards to imparle; and becauſe they were not brought in by Proceſs, they pray the Iudgment of the Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Plea was offered to the end that what was denied before upon a Motion might be ſettled by the Opinion of the Court, but it was over ruled.</hi>

               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:37883:121"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then they pleaded ſeverally Not-Guilty, and were tried at the Barr a Fortnight afterwards by a</hi> Middleſex <hi>Iury, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff replied, that he exhibited an Information againſt</hi> A.

B. <hi>the younger ſhould not knowingly or wittingly come into the Company,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then ſets forth the Bond and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thereof at large, and avers that</hi> A.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant re-joyned and ſaid, that the Plaintiff ought not to averr that the aforeſaid</hi> A. B. <hi>the younger is the perſon in the Condition of the ſaid Bond,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And upon a Demurrer the Queſtion was whether the Plaintiff was eſtopped by the words in the Condition to make ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued for the Plaintiff, that he might make ſuch an Averment which is to reduce a thing to a certainty which was very incertain before if it be not repugnant in it ſelf; nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Averment doth reduce contradictory things to a certainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis plain that</hi> A. B. <hi>the younger is bound in this Bond; the Objection is that</hi> A. B. <hi>the elder being of the Name and being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bound, that the Condition might referr to either.</hi>

               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:37883:121"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis agreed there are many Caſes where a Man ſhall be eſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to averr againſt a Record; but this Averment is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to any thing in the Record; for it appears by the Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that the Information was proſecuted againſt</hi> A. B. <hi>the younger, and therefore he muſt be intended to be bound not to come to the ſaid</hi> C. <hi>knowingly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If an Eſtate ſhould be deviſed to</hi> A. <hi>and the Name of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator omitted in the Will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Leon. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>yet the Deviſe is good by</hi> averring <hi>of the Name, and by proof that it was his intention to give it him by his Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So if the Plaintiff ſhould claim a Title under the Grant of ſuch a perſon</hi> Knight, <hi>and the Iury find he was an</hi> Eſquire,
<note place="margin">Lit. Rep. 181, 223.</note> 
                  <hi>but that the</hi> Knight <hi>and the</hi> Eſquire <hi>are both the ſame perſon, this is a good Declaration.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis uſual to make an Allegation even againſt the expreſs words of a Condition to ſhew the truth of an Agreement;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Car. 501.</note> 
                  <hi>as if Debt be brought upon a Bond of</hi> 100 l. <hi>conditioned to pay</hi> 50 l. <hi>within ſix Months; the Defendant pleaded the Statute of Vſury; the Plaintiff replied that he lent the Mony for a year, and alledged that by the miſtake of the Scrivener the Bond was made paiable in ſix Months. The Defendant rejoyned that it was lent for ſix Months only: And upon a Demurrer this was adjudged to be a good Allegation, though it was againſt the very words of the Condition, which is a ſtronger Caſe than this at the Barr, becauſe the Averment conſiſts with the Condition of the Bond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If a Man ſhould levy a Fine and declare the Vſes thereof to his Son</hi> William, <hi>and he hath two Sons of that Name,</hi>

                  <hi>then an Averment is made that he intended to declare the Vſes to his youngeſt Son of that Name; this Averment out of the Fine hath been adjudged good for the ſame reaſon given already, which is, becauſe it ſtandeth with the words thereof, and 'tis a good Iſſue to be tried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be objected that the Bond is illegal being entred into for the not proſecuting of an Information, becauſe a</hi> Nolle proſequi <hi>was entred as to that Matter, ſo 'tis the Act of the Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, It was ſaid that every Eſtoppel muſt be certain to every intent which cannot be in this Caſe, for by the words of this Condition 'tis incertain which of the Obligors ſhall be intended.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>This Caſe was argued at the Bar, and in this Term at the Bench</hi> Seriatim.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſingle Queſtion was,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">29 Car. 2. cap. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>whether this laſt Will, not being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed according to the Statute, is a</hi> Revocation <hi>of the firſt Will, or not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was admitted by all, that it was a good Will to paſs the perſonal Eſtate, but as to the point of</hi> Revocation, <hi>the Court was divided.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtice</hi> Lutwitch <hi>argued that it was not a Revocation: He agreed that if the laſt Will hath any reſpect to the firſt, it muſt be as a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37883:122"/>Revocation, or not at all, which revocation muſt depend upon the conſtruction and expoſition of the ſixth Paragraph in the Statute of</hi> Frauds, <hi>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the words whereof are,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Viz. That no Deviſe of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any clauſe thereof ſhall be <hi>Revoked</hi> otherwiſe than <hi>by ſome Codicil in Writing, or other Writing declaring the ſame,</hi> or by burning, cancelling, tearing or obliterating the ſame by the Teſtator himſelf, or in his preſence, and by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or conſent. But all deviſes of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be good, until burnt, cancell'd, torn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Teſtator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or unleſs the ſame be altered by ſome other Will or Codicil in Writing, <hi>
                     <hi>or other Writing of the Deviſor, ſigned in the preſence of three Witneſſes,</hi> declaring the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that the Queſtion will be, whether a Will which revokes a former Will, ought to be ſigned by the Teſtator in the preſence of three Witneſſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis clear that a Will by which Lands are deviſed ought to be ſo ſigned, and why ſhould not a Will which revokes another Will have the ſame formality?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Statute ſeems to be plain that it ſhould, for it ſaies that a Will ſhall not be revoked, but by ſome Will or Codicil in writing,</hi> or other writing of the Deviſor, ſigned by him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of three or four Witneſſes declaring the ſame: <hi>which laſt Clauſe is an entire ſentence in the diſjunctive, and appoints that the Writing which revokes a Will, muſt be ſigned in the preſence of three Witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before the making of this Act it was ſufficient that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator gave directions to make his Will, tho' he did never ſee it when made, which miſchief is now remedied, not in writing the Will, but that the Party himſelf ſhould ſign it in the preſence of three Witneſſes; and this not being ſo ſigned, but only publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Teſtator, in their preſence; 'tis therefore no good Revocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtice</hi> Street <hi>was of a contrary Opinion, that this was a good Revocation: That the words in the fifth Paragraph of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute which altered the Law were,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Viz. That all Deviſes of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be in Writing, and ſigned by the Party ſo deviſing, or by ſome other perſon in his preſence, and by his expreſs Directions, and ſhall be atteſted and ſubſcribed in the preſence of the Deviſor, by three or four credible Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In which Paragraph there are two parts,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The act of the Deviſor, which is to ſign the Will, but not a word that he ſhall ſubſcribe his Name in the preſence of three Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:37883:123"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The act of the Witneſſes,</hi> viz. <hi>that they ſhall atteſt and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Will in the preſence of the Deviſor, or elſe the Will to be void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the ſixth Paragraph is penn'd after another manner, as to the</hi> Revocation <hi>of a Will, which muſt be by ſome Codicil in writing, or other Writing</hi> declaring the ſame, <hi>ſigned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of three Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now here is a Writing declaring that it ſhall be revoked, not expreſly, but by implication, and though that Clauſe in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive which ſays, that the revocation muſt be by ſome Writing of the Deviſor, ſigned in the preſence of three Witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet in the ſame Paragraph 'tis ſaid that it may be revoked by a Codicil or Will in Writing, and therefore an expoſition ought to be made upon the whole Paragraph, that the intention of the Law may more fully appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such a conſtruction hath been made upon a whole Sentence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sid. 328. 1 Sand. 58.</note> 
                  <hi>where part thereof was in the diſjunctive; as for inſtance,</hi> viz. <hi>A Man was poſſeſſed of a Leaſe by diſſeiſin, who aſſigned it to another, and covenanted that at the time of the aſſignment it was a good, true, and indefeaſable Leaſe, and that the Plaintiff ſhould enjoy it without interruption of the Diſſeiſor,</hi> Or <hi>any claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under him; in this Caſe the Diffeiſee re-entred; and though the Covenant was in the diſjunctive to defend the Aſſignee from the Diſſeiſor, or any claiming under him; yet he having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for quiet enjoyment, and that it was an indefeaſable Leaſe, it was adjudged that an expoſition ought to be made upon the whole Sentence. and ſo the Plaintiff had Iudgment.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Chief Iuſtice</hi> Herbert <hi>was of the ſame Opinion with Iuſtice</hi> Street.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They find that</hi> Henry Warner <hi>and his Wife and</hi> John Ballat <hi>made this Surrender out of Court to the uſe of</hi> Robert Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>and his Heirs, who died before the next Court, and that</hi> John Freeman <hi>an Infant, was his Son and Heir.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſingle Queſtion upon this ſpecial Verdict was, whether this was a Forfeiture, and ſo a good ſeiſure to bind the right of an Infant.</hi>

                  <hi>It was argued for the Plaintiff in the Action that it was a good Seiſure and a Forfeiture till the Infant ſhould come of Age; for as a Copyhold is eſtabliſhed by Cuſtom, ſo likewiſe 'tis Cuſtom which obligeth the Infant to the Conditions thereof; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where one under Age hath an Eſtate upon a Condition to be performed by him,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In this Caſe the Cuſtom obligeth the Heir to be admitted, that the Lord may be entituled to a Fine, which if he ſhould loſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Tenant is an Infant, then that priviledge of Infancy works a wrong, which the Law will not permit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, an Infant ſhall not be prejudiced by the Laches of another, but ſhall be anſwerable for himſelf; and therefore if he is Tenant of Lands and the Rent ſhould be unpaid for two years, and no Diſtreſs can be found, a</hi> Ceſſavit <hi>lies againſt him, and the Lord ſhall recover the Land, becauſe of the Non-performance which ariſes by his own default.</hi>

                  <hi>So if one under Age be a Keeper of a Gaol and ſuffer a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to eſcape out of Execution,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>So the Law is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. El. 351.</note>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It hath been a good Cuſtom for the Lord to aſſign a perſon to take the Profits of a Copyhold Eſtate deſcended to the Infant during his Minority without rendring an Accompt when he came of Age.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>So that all taht is to be done in this Caſe is to enforce the Infant to be admitted, that the Lord may be entituled to a Fine: The Inheritance is not bound, but the Land is only ſeized</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque.</p>
               <p>E contra. <hi>It was argued that here is a general Seizure,</hi>

                  <hi>which cannot extend to an Infant, for he is not bound in a Writ of Right, much leſs in an inferior Court after three Proclamations; but if this had been a Temporary Seiſure the Iury ought to have found it ſo, which is not done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Iuſtice</hi> Dolben <hi>of the ſame Opinion, which he ſaid was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the reaſon of the Law in parallel Caſes: An Infant is priviledged in a Fine, for he is excepted by the Statute, becauſe he knows not how to make his Claim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaid this was likewiſe agreeable to the Cuſtom of</hi> 26 <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of which he was formerly Steward; for in ſuch Caſes he always marked the Court Roll,</hi> Nulla Proclamatio quia Infans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be a Forfeiture</hi> quouſque, <hi>becauſe an Infant is wholly exempted by the Cuſtom, and therefore 'tis no Forfeiture at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis an Objection of no moment, to ſay that the Lord by this means will loſe his Fine, and that he hath no remedy to make the Infant when of Age to be admitted, for no Fine is due to him before admittance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this Objection will be of leſs weight, if the loſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant be compared to that of the Lord, who looſeth only the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a Fine before Admittance; and ſhall this Infant who is now but three years of Age looſe the Profits of his Eſtate for</hi> 18 <hi>years?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there may be a way found out that neither may looſe; for if it ſhould be that when the Infant comes of Age his Eſtate ſhould be then forfeited, if he doth not tender himſelf to be admitted after three Proclamations; Now upon his admittance the Lord may ſet a reaſonable Fine, having reſpect to the length of time in which it was deteined from him.</hi>

               <p>Stowel's Caſe <hi>was no more but this,</hi> viz.
<note place="margin">Pl. Com. 356.</note> 
                  <hi>A Diſſeiſor levied a Fine with Proclamations, and lived three years, his Heir being under Age, and the five years incurred after the ſaid Heir came of Age, and then he entred within a year, and his Entry was adjudged unlawful.

<note place="margin">4 H. 7. c. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>for the five years being once attached and begun in the life of his Anceſtor ſhall incurr and go on, and bind the Infant, if he do not purſue his Claim within that time after he comes of Age; but 'tis to be obſerved that my Lord</hi> Dyer <hi>in the Argument of that Caſe ſaid nothing of a</hi> Seiſure quouſque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Chief Iuſtice was of a contrary Opinion from the other three Iuſtices, and that the Iudgment ought to be reverſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe until the Infant is admitted the Eſtate remains in the Surrenderor, and without an Admittance he cannot enter but by a ſpecial Cuſtom to warrant it; and for this reaſon 'tis that the Surrenderor ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs againſt any
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:37883:126"/>perſon who enters, becauſe he ſhall be intended ſtill in poſſeſſion, till the Admittance of another.</hi>

                  <hi>then Infancy cannot protect an Eſtate to which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant hath no Title till Admittance; for till then he hath neither</hi> Jus in re <hi>nor</hi> Jus ad rem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is a Condition annexed to the Eſtate to be performed by the Infant, by which he is bound notwithſtanding his Non-age, otherwiſe his Eſtate is forfeited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Cuſtom which obligeth him to be admitted is to entitle the Lord of the Mannor to a Fine to which he hath a right. Now Infancy was never yet extended to endanger that remedy, which Men have to recover their Rights; it has been often ſo far extended as to delay ſuch a remedy, but never to deſtroy it; for if the Infant ſhould die the Lord looſeth the Fine and then another perſon is to be admitted; but he cannot encreaſe the Fine upon him who is a Stranger for the neglect of the Infant.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now the reaſon in the Caſes of Coverture and Infancy is the ſame; for if there ſhall be a Seiſure during the time the woman is Covert, why not during the Infancy?</hi>

                  <hi>IN</hi> Ejectment. <hi>A ſpecial Verdict was found,</hi> viz.
<note place="margin">Deviſe of an Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in Fee.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator being ſeized in Fee of certain Houſes in</hi> Bedfor-Bury <hi>and in</hi> Parker's Lane, <hi>did by Will deviſe his Houſes in</hi> Parker's Lane <hi>to charitable Vſes; then he gave ſeveral ſpecifick Legacies to ſeveral perſons named in the ſaid Will; and then he deviſed his Houſes in</hi> Bedford-Bury <hi>to</hi> Edward Harris <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>his Wife for their Lives; then follow theſe words,</hi> viz. The better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>my Wife</hi> to pay my Legacies I give and bequeath <hi>to her and her Heirs</hi> all my Meſuages, Lands, Tenements and <hi>Hereditaments</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> not before diſpoſed of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion was whether this Deviſe would carry the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Houſes in</hi> Bedford-Bury <hi>to his Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adjudged that it did not, but that it ought to go to the Heir of the Teſtator, who was Plaintiff in this Caſe: It being found that</hi> Harris <hi>and his Wife were dead, and that the Wife who was Executrix had ſufficient Aſſets to pay the Legacies without the Reverſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Iuſtice</hi> Powel <hi>was of another Opinion; for that the word</hi> Hereditament <hi>imports an Inheritance, and if it had deviſed thus,</hi> viz. <hi>the Inheritance not before diſpoſed of the Reverſion had paſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Afterwards a Writ of Error was brought in the</hi> Exchequer-Chamber <hi>upon this Iudgment,</hi>

                  <hi>and according to the Opinion of Iuſtice</hi> Powel <hi>the Iudgment was reverſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nota. <hi>A Rule of Court was made, that no</hi> Certiorari <hi>ſhould go to the Seſſions of</hi> Ely <hi>without Motion in Court, or ſigning of it by a Iudge in his Chamber.</hi>

                  <hi>But Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>inſiſted that the Seſſions there did not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from other Courts and Franchiſes; for the inferior Courts in</hi> London <hi>are of as large a Iurisdiction as any, and yet a</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorari <hi>goes to them, and ſo it ought to go to</hi> Ely; <hi>for 'tis the Right of the Subject to remove his Cauſe hither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their courſe in the Royal Franchiſe of</hi> Ely <hi>is to hold the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions there twice a year,</hi> viz. <hi>in</hi> March <hi>and</hi> September, <hi>in which two Months the Iudges are ſeldom in Town; and if this Court ſhould deny a</hi> Certiorari, <hi>the Court of</hi> Common Pleas <hi>would grant it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Attorney General</hi> contra. <hi>This Franchiſe of</hi> Ely <hi>is of greater Priviledge and Authority than any inferior Court, for it hath many</hi> Regalia <hi>though 'tis not a County Palatine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Certiorari <hi>will not lie to the Grand Seſſions, nor to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Palatine, to remove Civil Cauſes; 'tis true, it lyeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Indictments for Riots; and this Franchiſe being truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Royal hath equal priviledge with a County Palatine, and therefore a</hi> Certiorari <hi>will not lie.</hi>

                  <hi>The Caſe upon the Pleadings was this,</hi> viz. <hi>A Leaſe was made of Land for</hi> 99 <hi>years if</hi> Margery <hi>and</hi> Dorothy Upton <hi>ſhould ſo long live, reſerving a yearly Rent and an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot or</hi> 40 s. <hi>in lieu thereof after the death of either of them,</hi> Provided that no Heriot ſhall be paid after the death of <hi>Margery,</hi> living <hi>Dorothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Margery <hi>ſurvived, and is ſince dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion was whether upon this Reſervation the Beaſt of any perſon being upon the Land may be</hi> diſtreined <hi>for an Heriot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>argued that it could not, becauſe the words in the Reſervation ought to be taken very ſtrictly, and not to be carryed farther than the plain expreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where words are doubtful they have been always expounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Leſſor;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Eliz. 217. 2 Roll. Abr. 448. Latch. 99.</note> 
                  <hi>as if a Leaſe be made for years reſerving a Rent</hi> durante termino <hi>to the Leſſor, his Executors or Aſſigns; the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor dies, his Heir ſhall not have the Rent, becauſe 'tis reſerved to the Executors.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But here is no room for any doubt upon theſe words, for if a Leaſe for years be made, in which there is a Covenant, that the Leſſee ſhall pay the Rent without any other words, this determines upon the death of the Leſſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>aſſigns his Term, and the Beaſt of the Aſſignee was taken for an Heriot, but adjudged that it could not, for the words</hi> his or their <hi>ſhall not be carried farther than to the perſons named in the Limitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Books that affirm that a Man may</hi> ſeize <hi>for an</hi> Heriot Service, <hi>cannot be brought as Authorities in this Caſe, becauſe they are all upon Tenures between Lord and Tenant, and not upon particular Reſervations as this is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The old Books ſay, that if a Tenant by Fealty and Heriot-Service,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Broke tit. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot 2.</note> 
                  <hi>made his Executor and died, that the Lord might</hi> ſeize <hi>the beſt Beaſt of his Tenant in the Hands of the Executor, and if he could not find any Beaſt, then he might diſtrain the Executor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plo. Com. 95.</note> 
                  <hi>and the reaſon of this ſeizure was becauſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the death of the Tenant, a Property was veſted in the Lord; but it was held always unreaſonable to put him to diſtrain when he might ſeiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it is now held that for Heriot-Service the Lord may either diſtrain or ſeiſe, but then if he makes a ſeiſure,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Car. 260. Jones 300.</note> 
                  <hi>it muſt be the very Beaſt of the Tenant, but if he diſtrain, he may take any perſons Cattle upon the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that admitting this to be Law, yet it proves nothing to this matter, becauſe ſuch Services being by Tenure, ſhall not be extended to thoſe which are created within time of memory, upon particular reſervations; for by thoſe ancient Tenures the Lords had many Priviledges which cannot be upon Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, the ſeiſures in thoſe Caſes were by the Lords, who continued ſo to be at the very time of the ſeiſure; but in our Caſe the Leaſe is determined by the death of the laſt Life, ſo the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is loſt, and then it muſt ſtand upon the particular words in the Deed.</hi> Sed adjornatur <hi>into the Exchequer Chamber, the Iudges being divided in Opinion.</hi> Vid. 2 Sand. 165.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he pleaded, that his Son</hi> Thomas Chappel <hi>was Copar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cener with</hi> Hannah Goddard, <hi>as Co-heires of</hi> Elizabeth Goddard, <hi>that</hi> Thomas <hi>came of Age, and that before that time</hi> Hannah <hi>died without Iſſue.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant pleaded, that neither the Plaintiff or his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did adviſe a Releaſe before the day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and upon Demurrer it was adjudged that the Plea was good, for the Defendant had an election to deliver or releaſe as the Plaintiff ſhould deviſe, which if he will not do, the Defendant is diſcharged by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Plaintiff; for the Defendant being at his choice to perform the one thing or the other, 'tis not reaſon that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ſhould compel him to perform one thing only.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>By the Condition of this Bond, the Father did as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for his Son, as</hi> Laughter <hi>did for</hi> Rainsford, viz. <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Houſe, or pay the Mony to</hi> Hannah Goddard; <hi>now the laſt

                  <hi>The Information ſets forth, that a Packet containing ſo many yards of Lace was imported by the Defendant from</hi> France, <hi>and that he did conceal it to hinder the Seiſure; and that he did privately ſell it</hi> contra formam Statuti.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon Not-Guilty pleaded the King had a Verdict, and on the</hi> 2d <hi>of</hi> October <hi>there came forth a general</hi> Pardon, <hi>in which were theſe Words,</hi> viz. That the Subjects ſhall not be ſued or vexed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their Bodies, Goods or Chattels, Lands or Tenements for any Matter, Cauſe or Contempt, <hi>Miſdemeanour,</hi> Forfeiture, <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> or any other thing heretofore done, committed, or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, againſt us <hi>Except all Concealments, Frauds,</hi> Corruptions, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demanours and <hi>Offences,</hi> whereby we or our late Brother have been <hi>deceived</hi> in the Collection, payment or anſwering of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues</hi> or any part thereof, <hi>or any other Mony due or to be due to us,</hi> or received for us or him, and all Forfeitures, Penalties and <hi>Nomine Poena's</hi> thereupon ariſing, and all Indictments and Informations or other Proceſs and Proceedings now depending or to be depending thereupon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion now was, whether this Forfeiture was excuſed by this Pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Attorney General argued, that it was not, becauſe an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is veſted in the King by the Iudgment, and that no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or general Pardon ſhall diveſt it without words of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So was</hi> Tooms's Caſe, <hi>who had Iudgment againſt another,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sand. 361.</note> 
                  <hi>and then became</hi> Felo de ſe; <hi>his Adminiſtrator brought a</hi> Scire Facias quare Executionem non haberet: <hi>The Debtor pleaded that after the Iudgment the Inteſtate hanged himſelf, which was found by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:37883:135"/>the Coroners Enqueſt returned into this Court. The Plaintiff replied the Act of</hi> Pardon. <hi>But it was adjudged for the Defendant; for when the Inquiſition was returned, then the Debt was veſted in the King, which could not be diveſted without particular words of Reſtitution, and which were wanting in that Act of Pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The moſt proper word in the Body of this Pardon which ſeems to excuſe the Defendant, is the word</hi> Offence; <hi>but the ſame word is likewiſe in the Exception,</hi> viz. Except all Offences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in collecting or paying of Mony due to us, and all Forfeitures, <hi>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the concealing of forfeited Goods from Seiſure is an Offence excepted; for 'tis a remedy for the King's Duty, of which he was hindred by the Concealment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, the firſt part of the Pardon excuſeth all Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours comitted againſt the King in his ſtanding Revenue; but this Exception takes in all</hi> Concealments and Frauds <hi>in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Revenue, and this Information is principally ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Fraud;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 Co. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo that the Exception ought to be taken as largely for the King as the Pardon it ſelf to diſcharge the Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Fraud tending to the diminution of the Revenue is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for it excepts not only all Concealments in collecting the Revenue, but other Mony due or to be due to the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If therefore when the King is entituled by Inquiſition, Office or Record, there muſt be expreſs and not general words to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it; and ſince this Fact was committed before the Pardon came out, and ſo found by the Iury, whoſe Verdict is of more value than an Enqueſt of Office; ſo that the King by this means is entituled to the Goods by Record, and that before the Pardon; for theſe Reaſons it cannot be reveſted in the party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion is what Intereſt the King hath by this Verdict; for as to the Offence it ſelf 'tis within the Body of the Pardon, for all Misdemeanours and</hi> Offences <hi>are pardoned; and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception doth not reach this Caſe, for that excepts Misdemeanours in anſwering of the</hi> Revenues. <hi>Now that which ariſes by a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can never be taken to be part of the King's Revenue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Revenue is properly a ſtated Duty originally ſetled on the King; and the Penalty to be inflicted for this Misdemeanour cannot be a Revenue, becauſe the Court have not yet given Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo that 'tis incertain what Fine they will ſet, and this appears more plain, becauſe the King may aſſign his Revenue, but cannot grant over a Penalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:37883:135"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Information is not grounded upon any Act of Parliament which eſtabliſhes the Revenue, but for concealing of a thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited to prevent the Seiſure thereof, which indeed may be a caſual Revenue, as all Fines are; ſo that if this ſhould be taken as an</hi> Offence <hi>committed againſt the King in deceiving him of this Revenue, then the firſt part of the Pardon diſchargeth all ſuch Offences and the Exception pardons none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis for theſe Reaſons that the Caſe cannot fall under any of the words in the Exception, no not under theſe Words,</hi> viz. Mony due or to be due to the King, <hi>becauſe no Mony is yet due to him. 'Tis true, the Iury have found it a Misdemeanour, which is finable; but until the Fine is ſet no Mony is due, becauſe the Court may ſet a greater or leſs Fine as they ſhall ſee cauſe: And if any other Conſtruction ſhould be made of this Exception, then every thing for which a Fine may be ſet, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and this will be to make the Pardon ſignifie nothing; for what is meant by Offences and Misdemeanours if they ſhould be pardoned, and yet the Fine ariſing thereon ſhould not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But admitting that all Offences relating to the Concealment of collecting of the Revenue are excepted, then this Revenue muſt be either antecedent or it muſt ariſe by the Fine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis no antecedent Revenue; this appears by the Book of Rates wherein the King's ſtated Revenue is ſet down, and no mention of this; ſo that the Revenue to which this relates muſt ariſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Offence; and what an abſurd thing is it to ſay, that all Offences are pardoned by one part of this general Pardon, and by the Exception none are pardoned?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, the Information is not grounded upon that part of the Statute which inflicts a Penalty upon the perſon who expoſeth prohibited Goods to Sale, for then they would ſue for the</hi> 50 l. <hi>therefore it muſt be upon the Forfeiture, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly pardoned; and though there is a Conviction, yet nothing is veſted in the King before Iudgment, becauſe it may be arreſted; and therefore</hi> Tooms's Caſe <hi>is in no wiſe applicable to this, for the Debt which was due to him was actually veſted in the King by the Inquiſition returned here, which found him to be</hi> Felo de ſe.

                  <hi>and therefore could not pawn it; but by the Civil Law in caſes of neceſſity he may rather, than the Voyage ſhould be loſt; and if any ſuch cauſe appear 'tis within the Iuriſdiction of the Admiralty, but then the pawning muſt be</hi> ſuper altum Mare.</p>

                  <hi>So that this is an excepted Caſe, becauſe of the</hi> Neceſſity; <hi>and 'tis like the Caſes of ſuing for Mariners Wages in this Court. The Service was at Sea ſo that the</hi> Admiralty <hi>hath no proper Iurisdiction over this Matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, Prohibitions have been denied for</hi> Mariners Wages; <hi>the firſt is reported by Iuſtice</hi> Winch,
<note place="margin">Winch. f. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>but the reaſon ſeems to be becauſe they proceed in the Admiralty not upon any Contract at Land, but upon the Merits of the Service at Sea, and allow or deduct the Wages according to the good or bad performance of the Services in the Voyage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, there is an Act of Parliament which warrants ſhe Proceedings in the Court of Admiralty for Mariners Wages:</hi>

                  <hi>For in a Parliament held in the</hi> 14th <hi>year of</hi> Richard II. <hi>the Commons petititioned for remedy againſt great Wages taken by Maſters of Ships and Mariners; to which the King anſwered

               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon this pleading they were at Iſſue at the Aſſiſes in</hi> Wiltſhire, <hi>and the Iury found a ſpecial Verdict,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> John Rowden <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of</hi> Richard <hi>(now the Defendant) was ſeized in Fee of a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage and</hi> 20 <hi>Acres of Land in</hi> Bramſhaw <hi>in the ſaid County, and being ſo ſeiſed, had Iſſue</hi> John Rowden <hi>his eldeſt Son, and the Defendant</hi> Richard; <hi>that on the</hi> 22th <hi>of</hi> Januarii 18 Car.

                  <hi>That after the death of the Father,</hi> John <hi>his eldeſt Son en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and was poſſeſſed in Fee-Tail, and was likewiſe entituled to the Reverſion in Fee, and died in the</hi> 14th <hi>year of King</hi> Charles <hi>the</hi> II. <hi>that the Lands did deſcend to another</hi> John <hi>his only Son, who died</hi> 35th Car.

                  <hi>The Council on both ſides did agree that this Land was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable with the Debt, but the Queſtion was whether the Iſſue was found for the Defendant, in regard the Plaintiff did not name the intermediate Heirs.</hi>

                  <hi>It was argued that the Defendant ought to be ſued as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Heir to his Father, and not to his Nephew, for whoever claims by deſcent muſt claim from him who was laſt actually ſeiſed of the</hi> Freehold and Inheritance, <hi>this is the expreſs Doctrine of my Lord</hi>

It was the Opinion of two Iudges that they were not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe the Vncle died in the life-time of the Ideot, and nothing attached in him;</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Man becomes bound in a Bond and died; Debt is brought againſt the Heir; it is not common to ſay that he had nothing by deſcent, but only a Reverſion expectant upon an Eſtate Tayl.</hi>

                  <hi>Then the Plaintiffs proceeded to prove their Title as Heirs at Law,</hi> viz. <hi>by ſeveral Inquiſitions which were brought into Court, and by the Heralds Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendants Title likewiſe was thus proved,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Lady</hi> Speke <hi>being ſeiſed in Fee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did by Will dated in</hi> March 1682. <hi>deviſe the Lands to</hi> John Petit <hi>for Life, Remainder to the Defendant and his Heirs for ever: That the Lady</hi> Speke <hi>died ſo ſeiſed, that</hi> John Speke <hi>the Tenant for Life, and Father to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was alſo dead,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Will was proved by ſeveral Witneſſes, one of which likewiſe depoſed that my Lady</hi> Speke <hi>made two other Wills ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to this now produced; and a Miniſter prov'd that ſhe burnt a Will in the Month of</hi> December, <hi>which was in the year</hi> 1685.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Plaintiffs produced another Will made by her at</hi> Chriſtmas 1685. <hi>atteſted by three Witneſſes,</hi> but not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of my Lady; <hi>ſo that though it might not be a good Will to diſpoſe the Eſtate, yet the Council inſiſted that it was a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the other, for</hi> 'tis a Writing <hi>ſufficient for that purpoſe, within the ſixth Paragraph of the Statute of Frauds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Caſe of Sir</hi> George Sheers <hi>was now mentioned, whoſe Will was carried out of the Chamber where he then was, into a Lobby, and ſigned there by the Witneſſes; but one of them ſwore that there was a Window out of that Room to his Chamber, through which the Teſtator might ſee the Witneſſes as he lay in his Bed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon which Evidence the Iury found this ſpecial Verdict,</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> Ann Speke <hi>being ſeiſed in Fee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did on the</hi> 12th <hi>day of</hi> March 1682. <hi>make her Will, and deviſed the Lands to</hi> John Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit <hi>for Life, and afterwards to</hi> George <hi>his Son, and to his Heirs for ever, upon condition that he take upon him the Name of</hi> Speke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the</hi> 25th <hi>of</hi> December 1685. <hi>ſhe</hi> cauſed another Writing to be made, <hi>purporting her Will, which was ſigned, ſealed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by her in the preſence of three Witneſſes in the Chamber where ſhe then was, and where ſhe continued whilſt the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſubſcribed their Names in the Hall, but that ſhe could not ſee them ſo ſubſcribing.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:37883:144"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>They find that the Leſſors of the Plaintiff are Heirs at Law, and that they did enter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This matter was argued in</hi> Eaſter-<hi>Term following; and the Queſtion was, whether this Writing purporting a Will, was a Revocation of the former or not, and that depended upon the Conſtruction of the ſixth Paragraph in the Act of Frauds,</hi> viz. All Deviſes of Lands ſhall be in Writing, <hi>and ſigned by the party or ſome other in his preſence, and by his expreſs Directions, and ſhall be</hi> atteſted by three or four Witneſſes, &amp;c. <hi>and that ſuch deviſe ſhall not be revocable, but by ſome other Will or Codicil in Writing,</hi> or other Writing, &amp;c. <hi>declaring the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the want of Witneſſes doth not make the laſt Will void in it ſelf, but only</hi> quoad <hi>the Lands therein deviſed, it hath its operation as to all other purpoſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It muſt therefore be a Revocation of the former; and this is agreeable to the Reſolution of the Iudges in former times, for there being nothing in the Statute of Wills, which directs what ſhall be a Revocation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">32 H. 8. cap. 1. Dyer 143.</note> 
                  <hi>the Iudges in</hi> Trevilian's <hi>Caſe did declare that it might be by word of mouth, or by the very inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Teſtator to alter any thing in the Will, for before the late Statute very few words did amount to a Revocation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moor 429. 1 Roll. Abr. 614, 615, 616.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Lands are deviſed and afterwards a feoffment is made of the ſame, but for want of Livery and Seiſin, 'tis defective, yet this is a Revocation of the Will, though the Feoffment is void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Council on the other ſide argued that this Will was not void by any Clauſe in the Statute of</hi> Frauds,
<note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
                  <hi>for if this is a Revocation within that Statute, then this ſecond Writing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a Will, muſt be a good Will; for if 'tis not a good Will, then 'tis not a good Revocation within that Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Man will affirm that the latter Writing is a good Will, therefore the firſt being a Deviſe of Land, cannot be revoked but by a Will of Land, which the ſecond is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Statute was intended to remedy the miſchief of parol Revocations, and therefore made ſuch a ſolemnity requiſite to a Revocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be denied but that this latter Writing was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be made a Will, but it wanting that perfection which is required by Law, it ſhall not now be intended a Writing diſtinct from a Will, ſo as to make a Revocation within the meaning of that Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:37883:144"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>If a Man hath a power of Revocation, either by Will or Deed, and he makes his Will in order to Revoke a former, this is a Writing preſently, but 'tis not a Revocation as long as the perſon is living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore a Revocation muſt not only be by a Writing, but it muſt be ſuch a Writing which declares the intention of a Man that it ſhould be ſo, which is not done by this Writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon the firſt Argument, Iudgment was given for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, that the ſecond Will muſt be a good Will in all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to Revoke a former Will.</hi>

                  <hi>the Iury found a ſpecial Verdict, the ſubſtance of which was this,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Leſſor of the Plaintiff was Heir at Law to one</hi> John Denham <hi>his Anceſtor, who being ſeiſed in Fee of the Lands in queſtion did by Will bearing date the</hi> 28th <hi>day of</hi> January <hi>in the year</hi> 1678. <hi>deviſe the ſame to the Defendant, which he ſubſcribed and publiſhed in the preſence of</hi> two Witneſſes, <hi>and they likewiſe atteſted it in his preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They find that on the</hi> 29th <hi>day of</hi> December, 1679. <hi>he made another Will or Codicil in Writing, reciting that he had made a former Will and confirming the ſame, except what was excepted in the Codicil, and declared his Will to be, that the Codicil ſhould be taken and adjudged as part of his Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They find that he publiſhed this Codicil in the preſence likewiſe of</hi> two Wineſſes, <hi>one of which was Witneſs to the firſt Will, bue the other was a new Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They find that theſe were diſtinct Writings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion was, whether this was a good Will atteſted by three Witneſſes, ſince one of the Witneſſes to the Codicil was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Witneſs to the Will, ſo that the new Man (if any) muſt make the third Witneſs.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Serjeant</hi> Thompſon <hi>argued that it was not a good Will: The Clauſe of the Statute is,</hi> That all Deviſes of Lands ſhall be in Writing and ſigned by the Teſtator in the preſence of three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and they to atteſt it in his preſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But here are not three ſubſcribing Witneſſes in the preſence of the Teſtator, ſo that the firſt Will muſt be void, for one of the Witneſſes to the Codicil did never ſee that Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, the Codicil is not the ſame thing with the Will; 'tis a confirmation of it, and this being in a Caſe wherein an Heir is to be diſinherited ought not to have a favourable Conſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Attorney General</hi> contra. <hi>A Will may be contained in ſeveral Writings and yet but one entire Will. 'Tis true, if it be atteſted only by two Witneſſes 'tis not good; but if the Teſtator call in a third perſon, and he atteſts that individual Witing in his preſence, this is a good Will though the Witneſſes were not all preſent together and at the ſame time, for there is the Credit of three
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:37883:145"/>perſons to ſuch a Will, which is according to the intent of the Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore it cannot be objected that theſe are diſtinct Wills, or that the Papers are not annexed, for no ſuch thing is required by Law; for a Man may make his Will in ſeveral Sheets of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and if the Witneſſes ſubſcribe the laſt Sheet 'tis well enough, or if he doth put up all the Sheets in a blank piece of Paper and the Witneſſes atteſt that Sheet 'tis a good Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In theſe Caſes the intent of the Law-makers muſt and ought to be chiefly regarded, and for what reaſons and purpoſes ſuch Laws were made, and what Iudgments have been given in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Caſes.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>and afterwards deviſes that he ſhall have the Rent as expreſſed in the Grant: Now though the Writing was no part of the Will, but of another nature, yet the Will referring to the Deed is a good Deviſe of the Rent-charge within the Statute of Wills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in this Caſe the Codicil is part of the Will, 'tis of the ſame nature, and being made</hi> animo reſtandi <hi>the end of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is performed for both Will and Codicil joined together make a good Deviſe; the firſt was a Will to all purpoſes; it only wanted that circumſtance of a third Witneſs to atteſt it, which the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator compleated after by calling in of a third perſon for that purpoſe.</hi>

                  <hi>tried at the Bar, the Caſe was thus,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>Peter Venables <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee of the Manor of</hi> Long Witton <hi>in the ſaid County, and being ſo ſeiſed made a Settlement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by Leaſe and Releaſe to the uſe of himſelf for Life, without impeachment of Waſte, then to the Truſtees for ſeven years, to raiſe Portions for Daughters, then to</hi> William Venables <hi>and the Heirs Male of his Body, and if he dye without Iſſue, then to</hi> Ann <hi>his Daughter for Life, with Remainders over.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Pollexfen <hi>argued that the Iuſtices had no power given them by the Law, to compel a Man to take ſuch an Apprentice, and this will depend upon the conſtruction of ſuch Statutes which relate to this matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt is that of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>which enacts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 Eliz. cap. 4. <hi>Paragraph</hi> 25.</note> 
                  <hi>that for the better advancing of Husbandry and Tillage, and to the intent ſuch who are fit to be made Apprentices to Husbandry may be bound thereunto, that every perſon being an Houſholder, and having or uſing half a Plough Land at the leaſt in Till age, may take any to be an Apprentice above</hi> ten, <hi>and under</hi> eighteen <hi>years,</hi> to ſerve in Husbandry, <hi>until the Party be of the Age of</hi> twenty one, <hi>or</hi> twenty four <hi>years, the ſaid Reteiner and taking of an Apprentice to be by Indenture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now before the making of this Statute, the practice of putting out poor Children was only in Cities and great Towns, to particular Trades and Employments.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:37883:149"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next Statute is</hi> 43 Eliz. <hi>by which power is given to the</hi> Church-Wardens or Overſeers of the Poor,
<note place="margin">48 Eliz. cap. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>to raiſe weekly or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by Taxation of every Inhabitant, ſuch competent Sum or Sums of Mony as they ſhall think fit, for relief of the Poor, and putting out of Children to Apprentice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then in the fifth Paragraph power is given to them by the Aſſent of two Iuſtices of Peace, to bind poor Children</hi> where they ſhall ſee convenient, <hi>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which words were the foundation for the making of this Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the conſtruction thereof can be no otherwiſe than,</hi> viz. <hi>Whereas before the making of this Act poor Children were bound Apprentices to Tillage, now the Church-wardens may</hi> raiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>to bind them out to</hi> Trades; <hi>for if they could compel Men to take them, what need was there of raiſing Mony to place them out?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This muſt be the natural conſtruction of that Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Jac. cap. 25. <hi>Paragraph</hi> 23.</note> 
                  <hi>which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears yet more plain, by the words of a ſubſequent Statute, which continues that of the</hi> 43th <hi>of</hi> Eliz. <hi>with this addition, that all perſons to whom the Overſeers of the Poor ſhall (according to that Act) bind any Children to Apprentice, may take, receive and keep them as Apprentices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, the general practice of putting out poor Children ſeems to warrant this Order; but this hath been occaſioned upon a Miſtake in Mr.</hi> Dalton<hi>'s Book,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dalt. 114.</note> 
                  <hi>who Reported the Reſolution of the Iudges in</hi> 1633. <hi>to be, That every Man who by his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, profeſſion, or manner of living, and who entertaineth and muſt uſe Servants of the like quality, ſuch muſt alſo take Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this Reſolution the Iuſtices of Peace have been governed ever ſince. But Iuſtice</hi> Twiſden <hi>would often ſay, that thoſe were not the Reſolutions of the Iudges, as Reported by Mr.</hi> Dalton, <hi>and therefore the Book was miſtaken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Order it ſelf doth not mention that the party to whom this poor Boy was bound Apprentice, did</hi> occupy any Land in Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, <hi>for ſo it ought to be, otherwiſe the Overſeers of the Poor may bind him to a Merchant or to an Attorny, which he called a Free quarter; for by ſuch means Diſeaſes may be brought into a Family, and a Man hath no ſecurity either for his Goods or Mony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was the Opinion of Iuſtice</hi> Twiſden <hi>in</hi> Coutrell's <hi>Caſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sid. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>and it ſeems to be very natural, and therefore the chief reaſon why power was given by the Statute to the Overſeers to raiſe mony, was that they might place poor Children to ſuch who were
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:37883:149"/>willing to take them</hi> for Mony, <hi>for otherwiſe they might compel a Man to receive his Enemy into his Service.</hi>

                  <hi>He relied on the Caſe of the</hi> King <hi>and</hi> Price, Hillary 29 <hi>and</hi> 30th <hi>of</hi> Car. II. <hi>which was an Order of the like nature moved to be quaſhed: And Iuſtice</hi> Twiſden <hi>ſaid in that Caſe, that all the Iudges of</hi> England <hi>were of Opinion that the Iuſtices had not ſuch a Power, and therefore that Order was quaſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis plain that by the Statute of the</hi> 43 Eliz.
<note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
                  <hi>the Iuſtices may place out poor Children where they ſee it convenient, and ſo the conſtant practice hath been; ſo is the Reſolution of the Iudges in</hi> Dalton, <hi>which was brought in by the Lord Chief Iuſtice</hi> Hyde, <hi>but denied ſo to be by Iuſtice</hi> Twiſden, <hi>for no other reaſon but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Iuſtice</hi> Jones <hi>did not concur with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> Price<hi>'s Caſe this matter was ſtirred again, but there hath been nothing done purſuant to that Opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since then the Iuſtices have a power to place out poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 'Tis no Objection to ſay that there may be an inconvenience in the exerciſe of that power, by placing out Children to improper perſons; for if ſuch things are done, the Party hath a proper remedy by way of Appeal to the Seſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three Iuſtices were of Opinion that the Iuſtices of Peace had ſuch a Power, and therefore they were for confirming the Order; and Iuſtice</hi> Dolbin <hi>ſaid it was ſo reſolved in the Caſe of the King and</hi> Gilliflower, <hi>in the Reign of King</hi> James <hi>the firſt,</hi> Foſter <hi>being then Chief Iuſtice, tho' the Iudges in</hi> Price<hi>'s Caſe were of another Opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Chief Iuſtice was now likewiſe of a different Opinion, for the Statute means ſomething when it ſays that a Stock ſhall be raiſed by the Taxation of every Inhabitant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for putting out of Children Apprentice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are no compulſory words in the Statute for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor any which oblige a Maſter to take an Apprentice, and if not, the Iuſtices have not power to compel a Man to take a poor Boy, for poſſibly ſuch may be a Thief or Spy in the Family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this Order was quaſhed for an apparent fault, which was, that the Statute has entruſted the Churchwardens and Overſeers of the Poor by and with the Approbation of two Iuſtices to bind Apprentices,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Churchwardens are not mentioned in this Order.</hi>

<note place="margin">Curia.</note> 
                  <hi>Iudgment was given for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If an Executor hath Goods of the Teſtators, and alſo other Goods in his own Right, and then grants</hi> omnia bona ſua, <hi>in ſtrictneſs the Goods which he hath as Executor do not paſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not</hi> bona ſua, <hi>but ſo called becauſe of the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which he hath, and therefore it muſt be a great ſtrein
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:37883:153"/>to make general words which are properly applicable to things which a Man hath in his own Right, to extend to things which he hath as Executor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was never the intent of the Party to releaſe more than what he had in his own Right, and that appears by the Recital of the Legacy of</hi> 5 l. <hi>and therefore the words which follow muſt have a conſtruction according to the intent of</hi> Donning <hi>at the time of the making the Releaſe, and ſhall be tied up to the foregoing words, and then nothing will be diſcharged but the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As if a Leaſe for years be made,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dyer 255.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Leſſor enters into a Bond, that he will ſuffer the Leſſee quietly to enjoy during the Term, without trouble of the Leſſor, or any other perſon; if an Entry ſhould be made upon the Leſſee, without the procurement or knowledge of the Leſſor, the Condition is not broken, for the laſt words are tied up to the word</hi> ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Legacy had not been releaſed by particular words, it would not have been diſcharged by a Releaſe of all Actions and Demands whatſoever; and therefore there would be a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience if theſe general words ſhould be conſtrued to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe any thing beſides this Legacy; for ſuppoſe there are two Executors and one refuſeth to Adminiſter, but meeting with a Debtor of the Teſtator, gives him a Releaſe of all Actions; will this amount to an acceptance of the Adminiſtration?

               <p>
                  <hi>As to the firſt Point, 'Tis plain that if that Court proceed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe Rules which are uſed and practiſed at the Common Law, yet no Prohibition ought to go after Sentence, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedy is an Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It cannot be denied, but that that Court had Cognizance of the principal matter in this Caſe, which was a Legacy, and Payment or not is a thing collateral. Now wherever they have a proper Iurisdiction of a Cauſe both that and all its dependences ſhall be tried according to their Law, which rejects the Proof by a ſingle Witneſs.</hi>

                  <hi>In the Caſe of</hi> Brown <hi>and</hi> Wentworth <hi>a Revocation of a Will was offered to be proved by a ſingle Witneſs in the Spiritual Court, which being denied a Prohibition was prayed</hi> in B. R.
<note place="margin">Yelv. 92.</note> 
                  <hi>but denied, becauſe the Will being the principal matter of which that Court had an original Iurisdiction, therefore the Revocation thereof, which was a collateral matter, but depending upon the Principal, ſhall be tried there; for when the Original belongs properly to their determination, all dependences thereon ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, and be tryed by them according to their Law.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi>it was upon a Libel for a Legacy, and</hi> Plene adminiſtravit <hi>plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which they endeavoured to prove by the Teſtimony of a ſingle Witneſs and denied: In that Caſe</hi> Croke <hi>and</hi> Yelverton <hi>Iuſtices were againſt the Prohibition, becauſe a Suit for a Legacy was a thing meerly Spiritual, and Payment thereof is of the ſame nature; ſo that the Eccleſiaſtical Court hath a proper Iurisdiction both of the Matter and the Proof.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>By theſe Inſtances it may be ſeen that 'tis not yet a ſettled Point that a Proof by one Witneſs in that Court is good;</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be a reaſon to grant a Prohibition to the Spiritual Court for refuſing ſuch Proof which is allowed at the Common Law, becauſe though the Proof by a ſingle Witneſs is allowed at the Law, yet 'tis not a concluſive Evidence, becauſe the Iury who are of the Vicinage are ſuppoſed to know the Fact and may give a Verdict upon that knowledge without Proof or Witneſs, as well as where there is but one.</hi>

                  <hi>In</hi> Michaelmas-Term <hi>following the Court were all of Opinion that no Conſultation ought to go, for as where the Eccleſiaſtical Court proceeds upon things meerly Spiritual no Prohibition is to be granted as in Suits about Probates of Wills,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo where they meddle with Temporal Matters or refuſe to admit ſuch Proof which is allowed at the Common Law, no Conſultation ſhall go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Law ſhould be otherwiſe it would be inconvenient for all Executors and Adminiſtrators, for if they ſhould be compelled to prove payment of Debts by two Witneſſes they might often fail of that Proof, and ſo pay the Mony twice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such Proof which is good at the Common Law ought to be allowed in their Court, and at the Common Law 'tis not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prove a Payment of a Debt by two Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They may follow their own Rules concerning things which are originally in their Cognizance; but if any collateral Matter doth ariſe, as concerning a Revocation of a Will, or Payment of a Legacy, if the Proof be by one Witneſs they ought to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tythes are of Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance; now if a Libel ſhould be brought for Subtraction of Tythes, and the Defendant proves by one Witneſs, that he ſet them out from the nine parts tho' the Parſon had not any notice of it (which he is not to have at the Common Law, though 'tis otherwiſe by their Law) that Court muſt allow this Proof otherwiſe a Prohibition muſt go.</hi>

                  <hi>AN Action was brought upon the Statute of</hi> Winton <hi>for a Robbery done in the Pariſh of</hi> Hamonſdworth <hi>in</hi> Longford Lane <hi>in the ſaid Hundred: The Caſe was thus,</hi> viz.
<note place="margin">A perſon was robbed who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to make Oath whether the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred may be ſued.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff employed one</hi> Coxhead <hi>his Servant to ſell fat Cattle in</hi> Smithfield, <hi>who ſold them for</hi> 106 l. <hi>which Mony he delivered up in two Bags to one</hi> Strange <hi>a Quaker, who was rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Company of</hi> Coxhead, <hi>he being alſo robbed of</hi> 12 s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They both gave notice of this Robbery to the Inhabitants of the next Village, and</hi> Coxhead <hi>was examined by the Iuſtice of the Peace dwelling in the County and Hundred where the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery was committed, purſuant to the Statute,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>before whom he made Oath, that he did not know any of the Robbers;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">27 El. c. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>but</hi> Strange <hi>being a Quaker refuſed to be examined upon Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Aſhcomb <hi>the Maſter brought an Action againſt the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and all this Matter was found ſpecially.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the Queſtion was whether the Action was well brought in the name of the Maſter; and ſo whether the Hundred ſhould be liable to pay the Mony of which the Quaker was robbed, he refuſing to be examined upon Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this Caſe the Statute of Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was conſidered, which was made in favour of the Hundred; for it enacts,</hi> That the Party robbed ſhall not maintain any Action againſt the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, except he give notice of the Robbery with convenient ſpeed to the Inhabitants of ſome Town, Vill or Hamlet near the place where he was robbed; and except within twenty days next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Action brought he be <hi>examined upon Oath</hi> before a Juſtice of the County inhabiting in the Hundred where the Robbery was committed, or near the ſame, whether he knew the Parties who robbed him or either of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was agreed that the Maſter may have an Action for a Robbery committed upon the Servant, but that is by vertue of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of</hi> Winton.
<note place="margin">Mich. 1658.</note> 
                  <hi>The Caſe of</hi> Jones <hi>againſt the Hundred of</hi> Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley <hi>is to that purpoſe, which was a Robbery upon himſelf, Wife and Servant, the Mony being taken from the Servant, and the Maſter made Oath that he did not know any of the Robbers, but it happened the Servant did know one of them whoſe Name was</hi> Leonard, <hi>of which he did then inform his Maſter; and this Matter appearing to the Iury it was found ſpecially, and upon
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:37883:158"/>the Argument of that ſpecial Verdict theſe Points were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Oath of the Maſter without the ſwearing of his Servant is good, becauſe the Servant had only the bare Cuſtody of the Mony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Information then given by the Servant to the Maſter of his Knowledge of one of the Robbers did not oblige the Maſter, becauſe the Mony ſhall be ſaid to be in his poſſeſſion and not of the Servant, the Maſter being then preſent, which is all the difference between that Caſe and this at the Barr; ſo that the Maſter is the perſon robbed within the meaning of the Statute of</hi> Winton <hi>although the Mony be in the hands of the Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suppoſe the Servant had received</hi> 1000 l. <hi>and not being able to carry it himſelf had employed ten Men, each to carry</hi> 100 l. <hi>and they had been all robbed, the Owner may have an Action againſt the Hundred upon the</hi> Affidavit <hi>of one of the perſons robbed; the reaſon is, becauſe the poſſeſſion ſhall follow the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and the poſſeſſion of the whole will follow every part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are Authorities to prove that if the Servant is robbed the Maſter may give Evidence what Mony was delivered to him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Roll. Abr. 685.</note> 
                  <hi>though that might be as well proved by another Witneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now though all this be admitted, yet an Action will not lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Hundred by the Maſter in the Caſe at the Barr; for the Statute of Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>being made ſo much in favour of the Hundred ought to be purſued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Reaſons why an Oath is injoyned by that Statute are:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the perſon robbed ſhould enter into a Recognizance to proſecute the Robbers, if he knew them or any of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Hundred might be excuſed upon the Conviction of ſuch perſon or perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To prevent a Robbery by Fraud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now ſuppoſe the Servant is entruſted with Mony, and robbed by Confederacy, ſhall the Hundred be anſwerable becauſe the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hath broke his Truſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Eliz. 142. 1 Leon. 323.</note> 
                  <hi>No, the Servant ought to be ſworn for the purpoſes mentioned in that Act, which if he refuſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath loſt his Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if the Servant is robbed in the Company or preſence of his Maſter the Mony is ſtill in Iudgment of the Law in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Maſter,</hi>

                  <hi>and that was the reaſon of the Iudgment in</hi> Jones's Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is not like the Caſe of a common Carrier, who though he may be ſaid to be a Servant, yet he is entruſted by this Law.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe 'tis not alledged that the Defendants of right ought to keep a Boat there, or that it was neceſſary for them to be always attending, for poſſibly it might require the uſe of skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men; and therefore in all Actions brought for not repairing of Ways 'tis alledged that the Defendant</hi> reparare debuit.</p>

                  <hi>and this muſt be very unreaſonable. 'Tis true, that a Cuſtom for Fiſhermen to dry their Nets upon another Man's Ground is good, which may ſeem to be a Charge upon the Land without any Reward; but the reaſon is, becauſe the catching of Fiſh is for the publick benefit, and every man may have advantage by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Cuſtom to have</hi> ſolam &amp; ſeparalem paſturam <hi>hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly doubted whether good or not; but 'tis now held to be good becauſe the Lord of the Soil might have ſome other Recompence for it.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe 'tis unlimited, for the Tenants may paſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi> ad libitum <hi>according to this Cuſtom, but it ought to be laid for their neceſſary occaſions, for otherwiſe the Defendants may be deprived of their Freehold, becauſe the Tenants may always keep the Boat in uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> 2d. <hi>Point was not much inſiſted on, which was, as to the matter of the Plea; only it was ſaid, that it was not ſo well to take away the whole Preſcription, that the Plea might have been good if it had been</hi> quouſque <hi>the Bridge fall or decayed, then the Preſcription doth revive again.</hi>

               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Another Exception was taken to the Declaration,</hi> viz. <hi>that all the Cuſtom is laid to be for the Inhabitants of an ancient Vill

               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe who argued for the Plaintiff held this to be a good Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,</hi>

                  <hi>as ſet forth by him, and as ſuch 'tis not confined to the ſame Rules with a Preſcription, which muſt have a lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement; but it is otherwiſe in a Cuſtom, for 'tis ſufficient if it be certain and reaſonable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Caſes cited on the other ſide are not to this purpoſe, becauſe they concern only ſuch Cuſtoms which relate to ſome Intereſt or profit in the Land of another perſon, but this Cuſtom is only in a matter of</hi> exemption and eaſment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was the very difference taken by the Iudges in</hi> Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood<hi>'s Caſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6 Co.</note> 
                  <hi>where it was held to be a good Cuſtom for every Inhabitant of a particular Town to have a Way over ſuch Lands to go to Church or Market, becauſe this was matter of eaſement and no profit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now a Paſſage over a River is no more than a way, and may be tied up to one or more perſons according to their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since therefore no Intereſt is claimed by the Plaintiff, but only an eaſment, this Preſcription need not be laid in the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but in the Inhabitants of the Vill of</hi> Littleport. <hi>It may be compared to a Caſe where a Cuſtom was laid for the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of a Town to pay a</hi> Modus <hi>in diſcharge of Tythes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hob. 118. Yelv. 163.</note> 
                  <hi>this was held good, becauſe it was by way of diſcharge in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Lands, without claiming any profit in that of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis alſo like the common Caſe of a Market, when a Man has pitched his Stall, there no perſon can remove it, for he hath a right</hi> ratione comorantiae.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then as to the firſt Objection upon the firſt Point, That a Cuſtom to paſs and repaſs,</hi> ad libitum, <hi>cannot be good; it was anſwered, this paſſage was in the nature of a High way, over which a Man may paſs as often as he will; and therefore 'tis well enough as laid in the Declaration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the Objection, that it ought to be laid in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not in the Inhabitants, it was ſaid this was an eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Plaintiff, and no ſuch thing can be to one man but it makes another a Creſpaſſer, and 'tis no Intereſt in the Plaintiff to be diſcharged of a Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Cuſtom to grind at the Lords Mill diſcharged of Toll, rules this Caſe; for is it not as much charge for a Lord of a Mannor to keep a Mill as for the Defendant to keep a Boat?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But he hath alledged a Cuſtom, and when ſuch Allegations are made, they ought not to be too narrowly ſearched for: No reaſon can be given why an Infant at</hi> 15 <hi>years of Age ſhall be capable to make a Feoffment in one Town and not in another?</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Then as to the third point, that this being laid to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ferry, the Plaintiff ought to ſhew ſome ſpecial damage to maintain an Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis not like the Caſe of a Common-High-way, as mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the other ſide, becauſe this Action is confined to</hi> Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>alone, and no Man is intituled to it, but ſuch who inhabit that Vill, ſo that every Man cannot bring an Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Exception to the form of the Declaration, that</hi> Adventurers-Bank <hi>is not laid to be in the Vill, it was ſaid that the Plaintiff only claimed a right of paſſage over the River, which is laid to be in the Vill of</hi> Littleport,

               <p>
                  <hi>It was held that the Cuſtom was well alledged, both as to the manner and matter; 'tis true, all Cuſtoms muſt have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable beginnings, but it would be very difficult to aſſign a lawful commencement for ſuch a Cuſtom as this is, ſo it would be for the Cuſtom of</hi> Gavelkind, <hi>or</hi> Burrough Engliſh, <hi>which are circumſcribed to particular places; and ſince 'tis ſufficient to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Cuſtom, by reaſon of the place where tis uſed; it may be as reaſonable in this Caſe to ſay that there hath been an ancient Ferry-Boat kept in this place; 'tis but only an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Cuſtom, which did not conſiſt ſo much in having a Right to the Paſſage, as to be diſcharged of Toll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This might have a lawful beginning, either by a Grant of the Lord to the Anceſtors of the Defendant, or by the agreement of the Inhabitants.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This may be as well alledged, as a Cuſtom to turn a Plow upon another mans Land, or for a Fiſherman to mend his Nets there.</hi>

                  <hi>it plainly appears that there muſt be an</hi> aſſent <hi>to it; for 'tis nothing elſe but a yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of an Eſtate to him who hath the immediate Reverſion or Remainder, wherein the Eſtate for Life or Years may drown by</hi> mutual Agreement <hi>between the Parties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, an</hi> Agreement <hi>is not neceſſary in Deviſes, nor in any other Conveyances, which are directed by particular Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, or by Cuſtom; but 'tis abſolutely neceſſary in a Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is a Conveyance at the Common Law; 'tis ſuch an eſſential Circumſtance, that the Deed it ſelf is void without it, 'tis as neceſſary as an Attornment to the Grant of a Reverſion, or an Entry to a Deed of Exchange, which are both likewiſe Conveyances at the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>a Surrender is ſometimes pleaded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Acceptance; but 'tis always that the Surrendree by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Surrender</hi> expulit &amp; ejecit <hi>the Plaintiff, which amounts to an Agreement.</hi>

                  <hi>that it will not preſume an aſſent without ſome act done; if therefore a Deed cannot operate as a Surrender without an acceptance, then in this Caſe no ſuch ſhall be preſumed, becauſe the Iury have found it expreſly otherwiſe; then by the birth of</hi> Charles Leach, <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Remainder is veſted in him, which ariſing before the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Surrendree, makes ſuch aſſent afterwards void, for there can be no intermediate Eſtate.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, if an</hi> Aſſent <hi>ſhould not be neceſſary to a Surrender, this inconvenience would follow,</hi> viz. <hi>if a Purchaſer ſhould take in ſeveral Mortgages and Extents, and keep them all on foot in a third perſons name (which is uſual) to prevent mean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, and the Mortgagor ſhould afterwards Surrender his Eſtate without the aſſent of the Purchaſer, if this ſhould be held a good Conveyance in Law, it would be of very miſchievous conſequence.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Eſtate is not immediately transferred to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendree at the ſealing of the Deed, without the aſſent of the Surrenderor, it ſhall not paſs afterwards when he gives his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that by way of</hi> Relation, <hi>for if that ſhould be allowed then the Surrenderor might have kept the Deed in his Pocket, as well fifty as five years after the execution thereof, which would be ſo prejudicial, that no Man could be aſſured of his Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, when a Bargain and Sale is made of Land,</hi>

                  <hi>ſuch a day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and two days afterwards the Bargainor enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Recognizance; then the Deed is inrolled, within the ſix Months, by this means the Conuſee of the Statute is defeated; for after the inrollment the Land paſſeth</hi> ab initio, <hi>and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee in Iudgment of Law was ſeiſed thereof from the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Deed, but not by way of</hi> Relation, <hi>but by immediate Conveyance of the Eſtate, by vertue of the Statute of Vſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Law will not ſuffer contingent Remainders to waver about, and to be ſo incertain that no Man knows where to find them, which they muſt be, if this Doctrine of Relation ſhould prevail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now ſuppoſe the Surrendree had made a Grant of his Eſtate to another perſon, before he had accepted of the Surrender, and the Grantee had entred, would this ſubſequent aſſent have diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Eſtate and made the Grant of no effect? if it would, then here is a plain way found out for any Man to avoid his own acts, and to defeat Purchaſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore 'tis with great reaſon that the Law provides that no perſon ſhall take a Surrender but he who hath the immediate Reverſion, and that the Eſtate ſhall ſtill remain in the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deror until all acts are done which are to compleat the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</hi>

                  <hi>held that the Eſtate paſſed immediately without the aſſent of the Surrenderor, and that even in Conveyances at the Common-Law, 'tis diveſted out of the perſon, and put in him to whom ſuch Conveyance is made without his</hi> actual aſſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, in Exchanges the Freehold doth not paſs without Entry, nor a Grant of a Reverſion without an Attornment, but that ſtands upon different Reaſons from this Caſe at the Bar; for in Exchanges the Law requires the mutual acts of the Parties exchanging, and in the other there muſt be the conſent of a third perſon.</hi>

                  <hi>But in Surrenders the aſſent of the Surrendree is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for the Eſtate muſt be in him immediately upon the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Deed, if he doth not ſhew ſome diſſent to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If a Man ſhould plead a Releaſe without ſaying</hi> ad quam qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem relaxationem, <hi>the Defendant</hi> agreavit, <hi>yet this Plea is good, becauſe the Eſtate paſſeth to him upon the execution of the Deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be a Queſtion, whether the actual aſſent muſt be at the very time that the Surrender was made; for if it ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, tis well enough, and the Eſtate remaineth in the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendree, till diſ-agreement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Preſumption ſtands on this ſide, for it ſhall never be intended that he did not give his Aſſent, but on the contrary, becauſe tis for his benefit not to refuſe an Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore where a Feme Sole had a Leaſe and married,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hob. 203.</note>

                  <hi>ſhe and her Husband made a Leaſe for years of her moiety, reſerving a Rent, during her Life, and the Life of her partner, then the Wife died: this was held to be a good Leaſe againſt the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Ioint-tenant till</hi> diſagreement, <hi>which ſhews that the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parties is not ſo much requiſite to perfect a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of this nature, as a diſagreement is to make it void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this may ſerve as an anſwer to the ſecond point, which was not much inſiſted on, that Mens Titles would be incertain and precarious if after the aſſent of the Surrendree, the Eſtate ſhould paſs by</hi> Relation, <hi>at the very time that the Deed was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that it was not known where the Free-hold was in the mean time, for if he had agreed to it immediately, it had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as private.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Then as to the Pleadings, 'tis true, that generally when a Surrender is pleaded, 'tis ſaid,</hi> ad quam quidem ſurſum reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, <hi>the Party</hi> adtunc &amp; ibidem agreavit, <hi>which implies that
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:37883:164"/>the Surrendree was then preſent; and in ſuch Caſe he ought to agree or refuſe. Beſides thoſe Actions to which an Agreement is thus pleaded were generally brought in diſaffirmance of Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to ſupport the Leaſes; upon which the Plaintiffs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and then the proper and moſt effectual Bar was to ſhew a Surrender and expreſs Agreement before the Action brought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It might have been inſufficient pleading not to ſhew an</hi> Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <hi>of the Surrendree, but 'tis not ſubſtance; for if Iſſue ſhould be taken, whether a Surrender or not,</hi>

                  <hi>and a Verdict for the Plaintiff, that defect of ſetting forth an</hi> Acceptance <hi>is aided by the Statute of Ieofails.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this Caſe there is not only the Word</hi> Surrender <hi>but</hi> * Grant and Releaſe <hi>which may be pleaded without any conſent to it, and a Grant by operation of Law turns to a Surrender, becauſe a Man cannot have two Eſtates of equal dignity in the Law at the ſame time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither can it be ſaid that there remained any Eſtate in</hi> Simon Leach <hi>after this Surrender executed; for 'tis an abſurd thing to imagine that when he had done what was in his power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a Conveyance, and to diveſt himſelf of an Eſtate, yet it ſhould continue in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Remainder in Contingency to the Leſſor of the Plaintiff was deſtroyed by this Surrender of the Eſtate to him in reverſion, for by that means when it did afterwards happen there was no particular Eſtate to ſupport it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>They find that</hi> Nicholas Leach <hi>died without Iſſue; that</hi> Simon Leach <hi>his Brother and Heir with Remainder over in Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency as aforeſaid entered, and afterwards married</hi> Anne, <hi>the Daughter of</hi> Unton Croke, <hi>and that after the ſaid Marriage,</hi> viz. 20 Auguſt 25 Car. 2. <hi>he executed a Deed purporting a</hi>

                  <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the ſaid Lands and Tenements to Sir</hi> Simon Leach <hi>in manner following,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>To all Chriſtian People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I <hi>Simon Leach</hi> of <hi>Elſefield</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxon</hi> Eſquire ſend greeting, Know ye that I the ſaid <hi>Simon Leach</hi> for divers good Cauſes and valuable Conſiderations me hereunto moving, have granted, <hi>ſurrendred,</hi> remiſed, releaſed and for ever quit claimed and confirmed, and by theſe Preſents do grant, ſurrender, remiſe, releaſe and for ever quit claim and confirm unto Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> of <hi>Cadley</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi> and his Heirs and Aſſigns for ever, all and every the Mannors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To have and to hold the ſame to the ſaid Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They find that</hi> Simon Leach, <hi>Brother of the Teſtator, was not</hi> compos mentis <hi>at the time of the ſealing and delivery of the ſaid Surrender.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That on the</hi> 10th <hi>day of</hi> November 25 Car. 2. <hi>(which was two Months after this Surrender made) the ſaid</hi> Simon Leach <hi>had Iſſue of his Body</hi> Charles Leach, <hi>who is his Son and Heir; that he after the death of his Father entred and made a Leaſe to</hi> Tompſon, <hi>by vertue whereof he was poſſeſſed until the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, Sir</hi> Simon Leach <hi>entred upon him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two Queſtions were made upon this Special Verdict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether this Surrender by a perſon</hi> Non compos mentis, <hi>was void</hi> ab initio <hi>and ſo could paſs no Eſtate to the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dree; for if ſo, then though the Ideot himſelf is eſtopped by his own Act, yet that can be no Barr to him in the Remainder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Act being void the Eſtate in Law ſtill remains in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If it is not void in its ſelf, then whether it is voidable after the death of the Party by</hi> Charles Leach, <hi>he claiming by virtue of a collateral Remainder, and not as Heir at Law to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:37883:165"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the firſt Point it was argued, that the Caſes of Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Infants go hand in hand, and that the ſame Reaſons govern both; that the Law is clear that a Surrender made by an Infant is void; therefore a Surrender made by a perſon</hi> Non compos mentis <hi>is alſo void;</hi>

                  <hi>the reaſon is becauſe they know not how to govern themſelves. And as</hi> Fleta <hi>ſaith,</hi> Semper judicabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur infra aetatem;

                  <hi>if he makes any Conveyance of his Land the Law hath provided a remedial Writ even for himſelf to avoid his own Alienation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Feoffments are void,</hi>

                  <hi>and if Warranties are annexed thoſe they are alſo void; if he granteth a Rent-Charge out of his Land that is likewiſe void; and if the Grantee ſhould diſtrain for this Rent after the death of the Grantor his Heir ſhall have an Action of Treſpas againſt him, and therefore by parity of Reaſon this Surrender muſt be void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> Fitzherbert Tit. Grantee pl. 80. <hi>there is a Caſe to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> viz. <hi>An Aſſize was brought againſt the Tenant ſuppoſing that he had no right of Entry unleſs under a Diſſeiſor by whom the Brother of the Demandant was diſſeiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Tenant pleaded that the ſuppoſed Diſſeiſor was the Father of the Demandant, whoſe Heir he then was, and that his ſaid Father made a Feoffment of the Land to the Tenant with War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and demanded Iudgment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Demandant replied, that his Father at that time was</hi> Non compos mentis, <hi>and the Tenant was compelled to rejoin and take Iſſue upon the Inſanity, which ſhews that if he was</hi> Non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos <hi>he could not have made ſuch a Feoffment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So if he maketh a Feoffment in Fee and afterwards taketh back an Eſtate for Life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fitz. Remitter pl. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>the</hi> Non compos <hi>ſhall be remitted to his ancient Title, which ſhews likewiſe that ſuch Feoffment was void, for the Remitter ſuppoſeth a former Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis incongruous to ſay, that Acts done by perſons of no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ſhall be good and valid in the Law, ſuch are Infants and Lunaticks; and it ſtands with great reaſon that what they do ſhould be void, eſpecially, when it goes to the deſtruction of their Eſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore 'tis held, that if a perſon</hi> Non compos <hi>releaſeth his right that ſhall not barr the King in his Life time, but he ſhall ſeize the Land; and if he die, his Heir may bring the Writ</hi> Dum non fuit compos mentis, <hi>and may enter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis for this reaſon that a Releaſe made by an Infant Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor is no barr, becauſe it works in deſtruction of his Intereſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 Co. 27. Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel<hi>'s Caſe.</hi> 34 Aſſ. pl. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>the reaſon is the ſame where a perſon</hi> Non compos <hi>maketh a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that likewiſe deſtroys his Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:37883:166"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>So likewiſe an Infant can neither ſurrender a future Intereſt by his acceptance of a new Leaſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Car. 502.</note> 
                  <hi>nor make an abſolute Surrender of a Term of which he is poſſeſſed, for ſuch a Surrender by Deed is void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis agreed, that if a Man</hi> Non compos <hi>maketh a Feoffment by Letter of Attorny 'tis meerly void, becauſe 'tis not delivered to the Feoffee by the hands of the Feoffor; but 'tis ſaid that if it be delivered by him in perſon then 'tis only voidable at any time by Action or Entry:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Finch<hi>'s Law.</hi> 102.</note> 
                  <hi>And of this Opinion was Sir</hi> Henry Finch <hi>in his Diſcourſe of the Law, who in the Margen of his Book quotes ſeveral Authorities in the Year Books to juſtifie this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and amongſt the reſt he cites Sir</hi> Anthony Fitzherberts Natura Brevium,
<note place="margin">35 Aſſ. pl. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>who taking notice of the old Authorities ſeems to reject their Reaſons, who affirm a perſon</hi> Non compos <hi>ſhall not avoid his own Act when he recovers his memory, becauſe he cannot then tell what he did when he was in his former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But certainly when he recovers his Iudgment, he is then of Ability to conſider what was done during his Inſanity, and to avoid ſuch Acts by ſhewing how his indiſpoſition came by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of God, by which he was diſabled for a time to do any reaſonable thing whatſoever; and this may be as well done as to plead</hi> dureſs <hi>from Men which the Law allows to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſary Acts void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord</hi> Coke <hi>in</hi> Beverly's <hi>Caſe taking notice of the great reaſon of the Civil Law in Caſes of this nature,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Co. 123.</note> 
                  <hi>which maketh all Acts done by Ideots void without their</hi> Curator's <hi>concurrence; and that it was objected as a defect in the Common Law, that Tutors were not aſſigned to ſuch perſons; he anſwereth, that our Law hath given the cuſtody both of them and their Lands to the King, which is directly contrary to his own Opinion in his</hi> 2d. Inſtitutes,
<note place="margin">2 Inſt. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>where paraphraſing upon the fourth Chapter of</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>which prohibits Waſt in the Land of Wards, from thence he inferrs that at that time the King had no Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to entitle him to the Lands of Ideots, for if he had, that Act would have as well provided againſt Waſt in their Lands as in thoſe of Wards: He farther adds that the Guardianſhip of Ideots did belong to the Lords according to the courſe of the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be it how it will, 'tis clear by all the Books that both by the Common and Civil Law their Acts are void; and my Lord</hi> Coke <hi>eſteemed it as a very unreaſonable thing that they ſhould not be avoided even during the life of the Party himſelf; but it was never yet denied that they may be avoided after his death by his
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:37883:166"/>Heir or Executor, and by parity of reaſon the Law will prevent Strangers from being prejudiced by ſuch Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is an Objection, that ſome Acts done by Ideots are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, as Fines levyed by them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, ſuch are not to be avoided, not becauſe they are good in themſelves, but the reaſon is, becauſe they are upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, againſt which the Law will not ſuffer any Averment to be made, preſuming that the Courts and Iudges in</hi> Weſtminſter-Hall <hi>would not admit an Ideot or Infant to levy a Fine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This being therefore a void Surrender by a perſon</hi> Non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos <hi>the Eſtate is ſtill in the Surrenderor, and ſo the contingent Remainder upon his death is well attached in</hi> Charles Leach <hi>the Leſſor of the Plaintiff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſuppoſing 'tis not void, yet there will be</hi> ſcintilla juris <hi>left in</hi> Simon Leach <hi>to ſupport the Contingency; and to prove this the Caſe of</hi> Lloyd <hi>and</hi> Brookin <hi>was relied on, which was this,</hi> viz. Thomas Bradſhaw <hi>was Tenant for Life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Mod. 92. 1 Vent. 188. 2 Keb. 881.</note> 
                  <hi>the Remainder in Tail to his firſt Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Remainder to</hi> Paul <hi>for Life, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to his firſt, ſecond and third Sons in Tail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thomas <hi>accepted a Fine from</hi> Paul, <hi>who had then a Son born, then he made a Feoffment, and afterwards</hi> Paul <hi>had another Son born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His eldeſt Son died without Iſſue, and it was adjudged that the contingent Remainder to his ſecond Son was not deſtroyed by this Feoffment, becauſe it was preſerved by the right of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which his elder Brother had at the time it was made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If this Surrender, is only voidable then whether</hi> Charles Leach <hi>claiming by a collateral Title can avoid it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued that he may, for it would be abſurd, that he ſhould have a Right to the Remainder, and yet have no Remedy to recover it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord</hi> Coke <hi>in</hi> Beverly's Caſe <hi>tells us that there are four ſorts of Privities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Bloud, as Heir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In Repreſentation, as Executor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In Eſtate, as Donee in Tail, the Reverſion or Remainder in Fee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>In Tenure, as Lord by Eſcheat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He affirms that the two firſt may ſhew the Diſability of their Anceſtor and Teſtator, and avoid their Grants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, in the third Article he is of Opinion that Privies in Eſtate ſhall not avoid the Acts of their Anceſtors, and he puts the Caſe of a Donee in Tail making a Feoffment in Fee</hi> within age, <hi>and dying without Iſſue, the Donor ſhall not enter, becauſe no
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:37883:167"/>Right did accrew to him by the death of the Donee, there being only a Privity of Eſtate between them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this Opinion is denied to be Law by Iuſtice</hi> Dodderidge <hi>in his Argument of the Caſe between</hi> Jackſon <hi>and</hi> Darcy,
<note place="margin">Palm. 254.</note> 
                  <hi>who ſaid that the Donor might enter, becauſe otherwiſe he would be without remedy, for he could not maintain a</hi> Formedon, <hi>becauſe the Feoffment made by the</hi> Infant <hi>was no Diſcontinuance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, 'tis not poſſible there ſhould be any Privity in Blood between the Donee in Tail and the Reverſioner in Fee, ſo that Article muſt be intended where they are Strangers in Blood and Privies in Eſtate, which doth not at all concern the Caſe in queſtion, becauſe</hi> William Leach <hi>is privy in Blood to his Father, who made the Surrender; and my Lord</hi> Coke <hi>tells us in the firſt Article of his diſtinction, that ſuch a Privy may avoid the Acts of his Anceſtor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be objected that this diſtinction was not then the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Court; for it was not material to the Point in Iſſue, which was no more than thus,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>Snow <hi>gave Bond to</hi> Beverley, <hi>and exhibited his Bill in the Court of Requeſts to be relieved againſt it, becauſe at the time of the ſealing and delivery thereof he was</hi> Non compos mentis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the like diſtinction was made in</hi> Whittingham<hi>'s Caſe many years afterwards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8 Co. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>which was thus,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>Whittingham <hi>being ſeiſed of Lands held of the Queen in Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage deviſed the ſame to</hi> Prudence, <hi>his Baſtard Child and her Heirs, ſhe during her</hi> Infancy <hi>made a Feoffment thereof to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and died in her Nonage without Iſſue; the Queſtion then was, whether that Feoffment ſhould prevent the Queen of the Eſcheat? And adjudged it ſhould not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In which Caſe it was held that</hi> Privies in Blood inheritable <hi>ſhall take advantage of the diſabilities of their Anceſtors, as if an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant who is ſeiſed in Fee maketh a Feoffment and afterwards dieth, his Heir may enter and avoid it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law is the ſame in the Caſe of one</hi> Non compos mentis, <hi>as in that of an Infant, as to the avoiding of the Acts of their Anceſtors; ſo that Mr.</hi> Leach <hi>being privy in Blood according to my Lord</hi> Coke's <hi>Opinion in thoſe Caſes ſhall avoid the Acts of his Father, he being</hi> Non compos <hi>at the executing of this Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it ſhould be objected, that this part of the diſtinction ought to be taken reſtrictively, and muſt be tied up to ſuch an Heir at Law, who takes an immediate poſſeſſion by deſcent from his Anceſtor; the Anſwer is, that if this Surrender is avoided Mr.</hi> Leach <hi>will take by immediate deſcent from his Father; for though nothing but a Reverſion in Fee deſcended to him, yet he is a compleat Heir.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But after all, this diſtinction made by my Lord</hi> Coke <hi>is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon no manner of Authority; 'tis only his extrajudicial Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for there is no reaſon to be given why Privies in Eſtate ſhould not avoid ſuch Acts done by their Anceſtors as well as Privies in Blood, becauſe the Incapacity of the Grantor goes to both.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe who argued on the other ſide held that the Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and perſons</hi> non compos <hi>were not void in themſelves but only voidable.</hi>

                  <hi>The Writs</hi> de Ideota inquirendo <hi>and</hi> Dum non fuit compos <hi>import the ſame thing,</hi> viz. <hi>that Acts done by them are not void, for the firſt recites that the Ideot</hi> alienavit; <hi>and the other, that the Lunatick</hi>

                  <hi>Beſides, the Caſes of Ideots (mentioned on the other ſide) and Lunaticks are not parellel; for an Ideot hath a different incapacity from one</hi> Non compos; <hi>'tis perpetual in an Ideot; and for that reaſon the Law gives the King an Intereſt in him.</hi>

                  <hi>Sir</hi> R.

               <p>
                  <hi>He died without Iſſue by Mrs.</hi> Carew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But before</hi> Chriſtopher <hi>had any Son born, the ſaid Feoffees made a Feoffment of the Land in Fee, without any conſideration; afterwards</hi> Chriſtopher <hi>had Iſſue two Sons.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it was adjudged in the</hi> Exchequer-<hi>Chamber, that the laſt Feoffment had diveſted all the precedent Eſtates, and likewiſe the Vſes whilſt they were contingent, and before they had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; and that if the Eſtate for Life which</hi> Chriſtopher <hi>had in thoſe Lands had been determined by his death, before the birth of any Son, the future Remainder had been void, becauſe it did not veſt whilſt the particular Eſtate had a being, or</hi> eo inſtanti <hi>that it determined.</hi>

                  <hi>The Grants of Infants, and of perſons</hi> non compos, <hi>are parallel both in Law and Reaſon, and there are expreſs Authorities that a Surrender made by an Infant is void, therefore this Surrender by a perſon</hi> non compos, <hi>is likewiſe void.</hi>

                  <hi>In all theſe Caſes which have been cited, where 'tis held that the Deeds of Infants are not void but voidable, the meaning is, that</hi> non eſt factum <hi>cannot be pleaded, becauſe they have the form, though not the Operations of Deeds, and therefore are not void upon that account, without ſhewing ſome ſpecial matter to make them of no efficacy.</hi>

                  <hi>Therefore if an Infant maketh a Letter of Attorny though 'tis void in it ſelf, yet it ſhall not be avoided by pleading</hi> non eſt factum, <hi>but by ſhewing his Infancy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But the reaſon is the ſame to make them both void only where a Feoffment is made by an Infant 'tis voidable, becauſe of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the Conveyance.</hi>

                  <hi>AN Information was brought upon the Statute of the</hi> 5th <hi>of</hi> Eliz. <hi>for exerciſing the Trade of a</hi> Cloth-Worker,
<note place="margin">Employing Workmen in a Mans own Houſe, he being not Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to the Trade, is an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing that Trade within the Statute. 5 Eliz. 4.</note>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon Not Guilty pleaded, the Iury found a ſpecial Verdict to this purpoſe,</hi> Viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Defendant was a Merchant, who Exported Cloath to</hi> Turkey, <hi>and that for the ſpace of a Month, he had emploied Men in his Houſe, in the Trade of a</hi> Cloath-Worker, <hi>which Men had been educated in the ſaid Myſtery for the ſpace of</hi> 7 <hi>years, that he provided Materials for them, and paid them weekly Wages, but that he himſelf was not an Apprentice to the ſaid Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was a Trade at the time of the making of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion was, Whether this ſhould be accounted exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a Trade within the meaning of the Statute or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe who argued for the Plaintiff ſaid, that true it is, any Man might exerciſe what Trade he thought fit at the Common Law, but this confuſion had been remedied by ſeveral Statutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt is the Statute of</hi> Edw. 3.
<note place="margin">37 E. 3. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that Merchants ſhall not engroſs Goods to enhance the Prices, nor uſe but one ſort of Merchandiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Afterwards in the</hi> 38th <hi>of</hi> Edw. 3.
<note place="margin">38 E. 3. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>the former Statute was repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and liberty given to Merchants only to uſe what Merchandiſe they would.</hi>

               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:37883:171"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then comes the Statute of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies intended by that and the former Acts were,</hi> Viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The reſtraining of ignorant pretenders to Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To make a diſtinction of Trades, and to fit them to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ranks of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To encourage thoſe who had undergone an Apprentiſhip, by prohibiting others to exerciſe their Trades.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The words of this latter Statute are,</hi> That no perſon, other than ſuch who do now lawfully uſe or exerciſe any Art or Myſtery, or Manual Occupation, ſhall exerciſe any Craft, Myſtery, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Occupation, now uſed within this Realm, except he ſhall be brought up therein ſeven years at the leaſt, as an Apprentice, <hi>nor ſet any perſon on work</hi> in ſuch Myſtery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being not a Workman at the time of making the Statute, except he ſhall have been an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, as aforeſaid, or elſe having ſerved as an Apprentice, ſhall become a Journy-Man, or <hi>hired by the Year,</hi> under the pain of 40 s. <hi>per</hi> Month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis plain by this Law, that he who cannot uſe a Myſtery him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is prohibited to employ other Men in that Trade, for if this ſhould be allowed, then the care which hath been taken to keep up Myſteries, by erecting Guilds and Fraternities, would ſignifie little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Caſe of</hi> Morſtyn <hi>and</hi> Nightingale, 3 Jac. 2. <hi>upon this Statute, it was proved that the Defendant emploied none but</hi> Pinmakers, <hi>in that Trade; yet not having ſerved an Apprentiſhip himſelf, the Plaintiff had a Verdict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was inſiſted on the Defendants behalf that as this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is laid in the Information,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
                  <hi>it was not within the firſt branch of that Clauſe in the Statute; for no Man will ſay that when the Defendant ſets other perſons to work ſuch employing them was an exerciſing the Trade within the firſt branch of that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither is it within the ſecond Branch, the meaning whereof is, that no perſon ſhall be employed but ſuch as have ſerved an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the perſon who ſets ſuch People to work is not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by this Law, but the Men themſelves who do work not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualified, and thoſe are not puniſhable in this Caſe, becauſe the Verdict hath found that they were Apprentices and had ſerved ſeven years to the Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis not material to ſay that the Men thus employed by the Defendant in this Trade are his Servants, and that by their working the Company of Clothworkers may be damnified, for the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:37883:171"/>Act is not reſtrained to particular Companies, but taketh care in general that the work ſhould be well done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Man will ſay that a Merchant is within this Statute, for the Preamble it ſelf ſhews 'tis for the Reformation of Trades and Manual Occupations; ſo that as a Merchant is not within the Letter, neither is he within the meaning of the Law, becauſe he is of a ſuperiour Order and Degree of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The chief deſign therefore of this Law being that unskilful Men ſhould not employ themſelves in Trades, and the Defendant having ſet none to work but ſuch who were of that Trade, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts in it, the meaning of the Act is fully purſued, and no injury is done to any perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, it doth not appear by this Verdict that any thing was done by the Defendant but in his own Family, and probably it might be for their uſe, and then 'tis no offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if it is a Crime in the Defendant, then all the Petty-Chapmen in</hi> England <hi>are within this Statute, for they uſe ſeveral goods belonging to particular Trades, and few of them have been Apprentices to any Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was ſaid by ſome of the Council who now argued this Caſe, that they had formerly attended my Lord</hi> Hales <hi>upon the like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe Opinion, was that ſuch Petty Chapmen were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute, but that they were warranted by the Cuſtom of thoſe places where they lived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Afterwards in</hi> Trinity-Term 3 Gulielmi &amp; Mariae, <hi>Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff by the Opinion of three Iudges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtions are two:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether this is a ſetting up of a Trade within the expreſs words of the Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether the working of theſe Cloths in the Defendant's Houſe will be uſing a Trade,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be denied but that at the Common Law a Man might exerciſe what Trade he would, therefore this Statute is pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Negative, to prevent many inconveniences which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened before the making of this Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some Authorities there are where Informations have been brought upon this Statute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Car. 347. 1 Sand. 312.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Defendants have pleaded the the Cuſtom of</hi> London <hi>for a Man Educated in one Trade, to exerciſe another; and upon Demurrer ſuch Pleas have been over-ruled; but reaſon in this Caſe is the beſt Authority.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iourny-men who work for Hire cannot be within the meaning of this Statute, but the Defendant by employing ſuch, had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Trade, and ſo 'tis found,</hi> viz. <hi>That he provided Materials, and paid the Workmen, and therefore he (and not the Maſter workman, who is but a Iourny-man) is the perſon who did exerciſe the Trade, not being an Apprentice; the management was for his Profit, the Workmen had no more but their Wages, and it would be very miſchievous if the Statute ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſtrued.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>unleſs ſhe is enabled by the Cuſtom of the place; and poſſibly ſhe might live ſo long with him as to be very skilful in it; but the Act being penned in the Negative muſt have a large conſtruction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Vſage againſt it will not take away its force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paying the Wages is as much as uſing the Trade himſelf; 'tis properly his driving the Trade by the Hands and Labour of his Servants:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Jac. 1. c. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>And it ſeems plain by the Statute of</hi> 1 Jac. 1. <hi>that this may be done, for that Statute Enacts that no perſon uſing the Myſtery of</hi> Tanning Leather <hi>by himſelf,</hi> or any other perſon, <hi>ſhall exerciſe the Craft of a</hi> Shoe-Maker, &amp;c. <hi>which ſhews that the Trade may be carried on by Servants and Workmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Goldſmith <hi>never makes his own Plate, he only provides Materials for the Workmen, but yet he is a Trader within the Statute, becauſe he makes profit of the Plate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An</hi> Inn-keeper <hi>who ſells Beer, Bread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in his Houſe is not within this Statute, becauſe 'tis part of his Trade to provide ſuch things for his Gueſts; but if he ſells any quantities out of Doors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Bulſt. 187.</note> 
                  <hi>he is then within the reach of this Law, which ought to have a very beneficial conſtruction, becauſe 'tis made to maintain skilful Men in Trades, which is for the publick good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis plain, that he who uſeth one Trade cannot exerciſe another, therefore a</hi> Coach-maker <hi>ſhall not make his own Whéels, if he doth, 'tis exerciſing the Trade of a</hi> Wheel-right, <hi>and ſo of the Iron and Leather, and the other Materials which make up a Coach.</hi>

                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:37883:172"/>Horn <hi>for his uſe in making of Combs; but there was a Verdict for the Plaintiff, for it was held to be an exerciſing of the Trade of an Horner; and the Council for the Defendant who were learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men did acquieſce under that Iudgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He who is a Servant, who undergoes no hazard, but is to have a certain reward for his labour doth not exerciſe a Trade, but 'tis the Maſter who emploies him, who hath all the Profit, and who in this Caſe ſells at the ſame rate as if he paid the Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Statute ſaith,</hi> That none who hath not ſerved as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice in any Myſtery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall uſe the ſame, <hi>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now he who employs Men in his Houſe uſeth the Trade,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For ſuppoſe a Merchant ſhould hire Iourny-men Shoemakers to work in his Houſe for the Plantations, this can be no other thing than the exerciſing of the Trade of a Shoemaker.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Private uſage is not within the meaning of this Law, but if what is done be for profit and gain, and not confined to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Family, 'tis an exerciſing of a Trade within the intention of this Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Defendant had ſold theſe Cloths in</hi> England <hi>he had been a Draper, and having exported them he is a Merchant: Wherefore for theſe Reaſons Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Iuſtice</hi> Dolbin <hi>was of another Opinion, he ſaid that no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement was ever given to Proſecutions upon this Statute, and that it would be for the common good if it was repealed, for no greater puniſhment can be to the Seller than to expoſe Goods to Sale ill wrought, for by ſuch means he will never ſell more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this Caſe there is no inconvenience to the Company of Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers, becauſe that Trade is a manual Occupation for hire; the Maſter Workman is the perſon who uſeth the Trade, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant hath done nothing but what is the proper work of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in his own Houſe which cannot be a publick uſe of the Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The intent of the making of this Statute was to prevent Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that there might be generally a good Manufacture. Now the Defendant hath well anſwered both theſe ends, for he hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Men in the working, and not only ſo, but ſuch Men who were bound Apprentices and ſerved ſeven years in that very Trade, ſuch who could work well and to whom he gave good Wages.</hi>

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that before that time Sir</hi> George Warburton, <hi>his Father, was ſeiſed of the ſaid Mannor, and likewiſe of one Meſuage in Fee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and being ſo ſeiſed made a Leaſe thereof for three Lives,</hi> viz. <hi>for the Life of</hi> G.

Et hoc paratus eſt verificare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant demurred to this Replication and had Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Matter now in Debate was upon Exceptions to the Barr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For want of a Traverſe that Sir</hi> Peter Werburton <hi>was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Fee at the time of the taking.</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued that the Replication was good without a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Co. Ent. 504.</note> 
                  <hi>for where the Plaintiff hath confeſſed and avoided, as he hath done here; if he had traverſed likewiſe, that would have made his Replication double.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He confeſſeth that Sir</hi> P. W. <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee of the Mannor, but afterwards the</hi> Seiſin <hi>was expreſly alledged to be in Sir</hi> George <hi>the Father, and that the place where was parcel thereof, which is a Confeſſion and an Avoidance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Avowant ſhould have traverſed this Leaſe, but the Traverſe of the Plaintiff upon him had made it a worſe Iſſue.</hi>

               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:37883:173"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agreeable to this Caſe in reaſon is that which was adjudged in this Court in</hi> Michaelmas-Term 10 Car. 1. <hi>It was in Treſpaſs;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Car. 384.</note> 
                  <hi>the Defendant pleaded that the</hi> locus in quo <hi>was the ſole</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of <hi>John,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and juſtified by his Command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff replyed that the Land was parcel of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of</hi> Abbots Anne, <hi>and that</hi> W. <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee, and levied a Fine to the uſe of himſelf and Wife for their Lives, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to</hi> E. <hi>for</hi> 100 <hi>years if he lived ſo long, who after the death of the Cognizors entred and made a Leaſe to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And upon a Demurrer to this Replication the ſame Exception was then taken as now,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Plaintiff did not confeſs and avoid the</hi> Freehold of <hi>
                     <hi>John;</hi> but the Plaintiff had Iudgment, for the Barr being at large and the Title in the Replication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe ſo too, the Plaintiff may claim by a Leaſe for years without anſwering the Freehold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The not concluding with a Traverſe is but a form, and the Court will proceed according to the Right of the Cauſe without ſuch form;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">27 Eliz. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>'tis a defect which after a Ioinder in Demurrer is expreſly helped by the Statute of Ieofails, which enables the Court to amend defects and want of Forms other than ſuch for which the party hath demurred.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Caſe of</hi> Edwards <hi>and</hi> Woodden <hi>is in point,</hi>

                  <hi>it was in</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevin; <hi>the Defendant made Cognizance as Bailiff to</hi> Cotton, <hi>for that the place where,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was ſo many Acres parcel of a Mannor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that</hi> Bing <hi>was ſeiſed thereof in Fee, who granted a Rent Charge out of it to Sir</hi> Robert Heath <hi>in Fee, who ſold it to</hi> Cotton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff in Barr to the Conuſance replied, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the Land was parcel of the Mannor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that</hi> Bing was ſeiſed in Fee <hi>
                     <hi>prout, &amp;c.</hi> and granted the Rent to Sir</hi> R. H. <hi>but that long before the</hi> Seiſin <hi>of</hi> Bing, <hi>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one</hi> Leigh <hi>was ſeiſed thereof in Fee, who deviſed it to</hi> Blunt <hi>for a Term of years, which Term by ſeveral Aſſignments came to</hi> Claxton, <hi>who gave the Plaintiff leave to put in his Cattel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And upon a Demurrer to this Replication an Exception was taken to it, for that the Plaintiff did not ſhew how the</hi> Seiſin <hi>and Grant of</hi> Bing <hi>to Sir</hi> R.

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo to</hi> Claxton, <hi>it may be intended that the Grantor was only ſeiſed in Fee of the Reverſion, and therefore the Plaintiff ought to have traverſed the</hi> Seiſin aliter vel alio modo.</p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:37883:174"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But three Iudges ſeemed to encline that the Replication was good, and that the Plaintiff had well confeſſed and avoided that</hi> Seiſin <hi>in Fee which was alledged by the Defendant, for he had ſhewed a Leaſe for years precedent to the Defendants Title, and which was not chargeable with the Rent; and his pleading that the Grantor</hi> Bing <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee muſt be only of a Reverſion expectant upon that Leaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if his Confeſſion that</hi> Being <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee</hi> prout, &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be intended a</hi> Seiſin <hi>in Fee in poſſeſſion, yet the Replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is good in ſubſtance, becauſe the Charge againſt the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is avoided by a former Eſtate, and in ſuch Caſe 'tis not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take a Traverſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But after all it was held that if it be a defect, 'tis but want of a Form, which is aided by the Statute, and that is this very Caſe now in queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The want of a Traverſe ſeldom makes a Plea ill in ſubſtance, but a naughty Traverſe often makes it ſo, becauſe the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is tied up to that which is material in it ſelf, ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer what is proper and material; and therefore in</hi> Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>upon a Leaſe made by</hi> E. I.
<note place="margin">Yelv. 151. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del <hi>verſus</hi> Lull.</note> 
                  <hi>the Defendant pleaded that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> E. I. <hi>had any thing to do,</hi> &amp;c. M. I. <hi>was ſeiſed in Fee, after whoſe death the Land deſcended to his Heir, and that</hi> E. <hi>entred and was ſeized by Abatement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff replied and confeſſed the</hi> Seiſin <hi>of</hi> M. <hi>but ſaith that he deviſed it in Fee to</hi> E. I. <hi>who entred,</hi> abſque hoc <hi>that</hi> E. I. <hi>was ſeized by Abatement, and upon a Demurrer this was held to be an ill Traverſe, for the Plaintiff had confeſſed the</hi> Seiſin <hi>of</hi> M. <hi>and avoided it by the Deviſe, and therefore ought not to have traverſed the Abatement, for having derived a good Title by the Deviſe to his Leſſor, 'tis an Argument that he entred lawfully, and it was that alone which was iſſuable, and not the Abatement; therefore it was ill to traverſe that, becauſe it muſt never be taken but where the thing traverſed is iſſuable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then it was ſaid that the Conuſance was informal, becauſe the Avowant ſhould have ſaid that the</hi> Locus in quo, &amp;c. <hi>contains ſo many Acres of Ground,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he only ſaith that it was parcel of a Mannor; beſides, he neither prays Damages, nor</hi> Retorn' Habend'.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the</hi> 2d <hi>Point it was ſaid that the Statute of Frauds doth not take away all Occupancy, it only appoints who ſhall be a ſpecial Occupant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, here is a Title within the Statute, for a Leaſe for Lives is perſonal Aſſets, ſo is a Term in the Hands of an</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor de ſon tort, <hi>and in this Caſe the entring of one Brother

                  <hi>and it was never yet doubted, but that there may be ſuch an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of a Term. Whereupon it was concluded that the Barr was good, both as to the Form and Title ſet forth, but no Iudgment was then given.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>THE Plaintiff declared that the Defendant and ſeven other perſons were Proprietors of a Veſſel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Where there are ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of a Veſſel, and Goods are damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by carriage the Action muſt be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them all.</note> 
                  <hi>in which they uſed to carry Goods for a reaſonable hire from Port to Port.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had loaded the ſaid Veſſel with Boards which were agreed to be ſafely tranſported from</hi> London <hi>to</hi> Topſam, <hi>and that the Defendant by neglect ſuffered them to be dampnified,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon Not-Guilty pleaded a ſpecial Verdict was found, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof was,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Plaintiff did load the Ship with Boards, of which Ship the Defendant and ſeven other perſons were Proprietors; that the ſaid Ship did uſually carry Goods for hire; that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff delivered the Goods to</hi> Daniel Hull, <hi>who was Maſter of the Veſſel, and that they were loaded therein, but that none of the Proprietors were preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there was no actual Contract between the Plaintiff and the Proprietors, or any Negligence in them, but the Boards were dampnified by the neglect of the ſaid Maſter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtions upon this ſpecial Verdict were two:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether this Action would lie againſt the Defendant alone as one of the Proprietors, or whether it muſt be brought againſt them all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Action ought to be brought againſt them all, then Not-Guilty was not a proper Plea, becauſe the Defendant ought to have pleaded in Abatement that the reſt of the Owners</hi> ſuper ſe ſuſceperunt ſimul cum <hi>the Defendant</hi> abſque hoc quod <hi>he</hi> ſuper ſe ſuſcepit tantum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was argued for the Plaintiff that the Action may be well brought againſt any ſingle perſon of the Proprietors, becauſe 'tis grounded upon a</hi> Tort <hi>as well as upon a Contract, which in this Caſe is only an Inducement to the Action, and therefore the Plaintiff hath liberty to bring it either the one way or the other, for 'tis both joint and ſeveral.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:37883:175"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>So it is in</hi> Trover, <hi>where a Man declares that he was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſuch Goods, that the Defendant found them and promiſed to deliver them, but converted them to his own uſe; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is but Iuducement, for the cauſe of Action ariſes upon the Converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is a remedy given by the conſtruction of the Law, and if ſo, it muſt be certain and effectual to all intents; and therefore it hath been ruled in an Action brought againſt a common Carrier upon the</hi> Aſſumpſit <hi>in Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sid. 244.</note> 
                  <hi>and likewiſe upon the</hi> Tort, <hi>that the Declaration was ill, and though the Plaintiff had a Verdict, yet the Iudgment was arreſted, becauſe he had declared both ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agreeable to this was that Iudgment which was given upon the Statute of</hi> 2 Ed.
<note place="margin">Hutt. 121, 122.</note> 3. <hi>for not ſetting out of Tythes in an Action of Debt brought againſt two Tenants in Common, it happened that one of them ſet out the Tythes and the other carried them away, and becauſe the Action was brought againſt both it was held to be ill, for it lies only againſt him which did the wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Action ought to be brought againſt all, then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſhould have taken advantage of it by pleading, and to have ſhewed who were the Proprietors with himſelf; for 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Plaintiff to know who they are; and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Plea is not good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>E contra.
<note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
                  <hi>The Plaintiff ought to have brought his Action either againſt the Maſter alone or all the Proprietors; 'tis true, if this had been only an Action of a ſimple Treſpaſs he might have brought it againſt all or one; but this ſounds not only in a Wrong, but 'tis in Breach of a Covenant or Duty, and ſo ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced againſt all of them as common Carriers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the great reaſon why all are liable to an Action is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they all have a reward for the Hire of the Veſſel; and it ſeems very unreaſonable that one ſhould bear the burthen, and the reſt run away with the profit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The principal Caſe in</hi> Hutton <hi>is an Authority directly to this purpoſe, though it was otherwiſe quoted by the Plaintiffs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; it was Debt upon the Statute of</hi> Ed. 6. <hi>brought againſt one Leſſee for not ſetting out of Tythes, and it appeared upon the Evidence that two were jointly poſſeſſed of the Term, and for that reaſon it was held that the Action would not lie againſt one alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Defendant ought not to have pleaded in Abatement that the reſt of the Proprietors</hi> ſuper ſe ſuſceperunt ſimul cum <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>becauſe ſuch a Plea would not have been good here; for he ſhall never be compelled to plead in Abatement either in
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:37883:175"/>Debt or Contract, but in one ſingle Caſe, and that is where two are bound jointly, and one is ſued, he may plead in Abatement,</hi>

               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Judicium.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Action ought to be brought againſt all the Partowners, becauſe they have all an equal benefit, and the ground of the Action is upon a Truſt repoſed in all, and every Truſt ſuppoſeth a Contract;</hi>

                  <hi>There are many Caſes where the act of the Servant ſhall charge the Maſter; as for inſtance,</hi> viz.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord</hi> North <hi>appointed one</hi> Benger, <hi>who was his Clerk to take the Bond, which was done, who delivered it to the Lord, and he delivered it back again to his Clerk in order to ſend it to the Clerk of the Court of Augmentations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Benger <hi>ſuppreſſed this Bond, and it was the Opinion of all the Iudges of</hi> England, <hi>that the Lord</hi> North <hi>was chargeable to the King, becauſe the poſſeſſion of the Bond by his Servant and by his Order was his own poſſeſſion.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>'Tis true, in</hi> Overton <hi>and</hi> Sydal<hi>'s Caſe, it was reſolved that if an Executor of Leſſee for years aſſign his Intereſt, Debt for Rent will not lye againſt him, after ſuch Aſſignment, the reaſon there given was, becauſe the perſonal privity of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is determined by the death of the Leſſee, as to the Debt it ſelf; and for the ſame reaſon the Executor ſhall not be lyable to the Rent, after the death of the Leſſee, if ſuch Leſſee doth make an aſſignment of his Term, in his life-time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>in his third Report, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that it was reſolved by</hi> Popham <hi>Chief Iuſtice, and the whole Court, that if an Executor of a Leſſee for years, aſſign his Intereſt,</hi> Debt <hi>will not lye againſt him for Rent due after ſuch an Aſſignment;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pop. 120.</note> 
                  <hi>but my Lord</hi> Popham <hi>himſelf in Reporting that very Caſe, tells us he was of another Opinion, which was, that ſo long as the Covenant in the Leaſe hath the nature and eſſence of a Contract, it ſhall bind the Executor of the Leſſee, who as well to that, as to many other purpoſes, repreſents the perſon of the Teſtator, and is privy to his Contracts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tis true, my Lord</hi> Popham <hi>held in that Caſe, that the Action did not lye, but becauſe it was brought by the Succeſſor of a Prebendary, upon a Leaſe made by him in his life-time, who being a ſingle Corporation, the perſonal Contract was determined by his death.</hi>

                  <hi>Serjeant</hi> Thomſon <hi>argued, that he was not within any of the Statutes of Bankrupcy, for an</hi> Inn-Keeper <hi>is under many obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and circumſtances different from all other Trades-men; for he is to take care of the Goods of Travellers, and if he ſet any unreaſonable Price upon his Goods, 'tis an Offence which the Iuſtices of Peace and Stewards in their Leets have power to hear and determine.</hi>

                  <hi>Iuſtice</hi> Berkley <hi>in the arguing of that Caſe agreed, that he who getteth his Living by Buying and Selling, and not by both, is not within the Statutes, but the Iury having found that he got a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood by both, and uſing the Trade of an</hi> Inholder, <hi>therefore he was a Bankrupt: But the other three Iudges were of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion, becauſe an</hi> Inn-Keeper <hi>cannot properly be ſaid to ſell his Goods.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>As to his having a Share in a Ship, 'tis no more than a Stock to Trade, which may go to an Infant, or to an Executor after his deceaſe, and if either of theſe perſons ſhould Trade with it, they cannot be made Bankrupts, becauſe 'tis in</hi> auter droit.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tho' a Man is of a particular Trade, yet if it doth not appear that he got his Livelyhood</hi> by Buying and Selling, <hi>'tis not actiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to call ſuch a perſon Bankrupt.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>HE brought a</hi> Mandamus <hi>to be reſtored to the Office of a Proctor of</hi> Doctors Commons.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mandamus</hi> will not lie for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Proctor of <hi>Doctors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Return was, that the Court was the ſupreme Court of the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>who had the Government thereof; that he appointed a Iudge of the ſaid Court, who had power to alter and diſplace Officers; that the Defendant was admitted and ſworn a Proctor of the Court and took an Oath to obey the Orders thereof; that part of the ſaid Oath was,</hi> That no Proctor ſhould do any thing in that Court <hi>
                  <hi>without the Advice of an Advocate;</hi> that he had done Buſineſs without ſuch advice in a certain Cauſe there depending; and that he refuſed to pay a Tax of</hi> 10 s. <hi>impoſed upon him by Order of the Court towards the Charges of the Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Queſtions upon this Return were,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether a</hi> Mandamus <hi>will lie to reſtore a perſon to the Office of a Proctor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether a ſufficient cauſe was returned to diſplace Mr.</hi> Leigh?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the firſt, It was held that a</hi> Mandamus <hi>doth lie, becauſe 'tis a publick Office, and concerns the Adminiſtration of Iuſtice; and the Proctors being limited to a certain number,</hi> viz. 28. <hi>if many of them ſhould be diſplaced it would be a means to hinder Iuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Court doth judicially take notice of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, by prohibiting them, by taking notice of their Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or of any proceedings, when they are againſt the Law of the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="333" facs="tcp:37883:180"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A Proctor doth the Buſineſs in that Court as as Attorney in</hi> B. R. <hi>and Notice is taken of his place as judicially as of any other Officer;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sid. 94, 152.</note> 
               <hi>and as to this purpoſe thoſe Officers cannot be diſtinguiſhed; if therefore a</hi> Mandamus <hi>hath been granted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore an Attorny, why not a Proctor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Plaintiff hath no remedy but by a</hi> Mandamus, <hi>becauſe an Aſſize will not lie of this Office; 'tis admitted that an Action on the Caſe may be brought, but then Damages only are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and not the Office; and it would be very inconvenient to leave it to a Iury to give ſuch Damages as the Party may ſuſtain for the loſs of his Livelyhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis no Objection to ſay, that there is a proper Viſitor, in this Caſe to whom to appeal,</hi> viz. <hi>to the Archbiſhop; for they have not ſet out any ſuch viſitatorial power in the Return; or if any, that he had power to reſtore him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if ſuch Power had appeared upon the Return, yet a Proctor ought not to appeal to the Archbiſhop or to the Guardian of the Spiritualties</hi> Sede vacante, <hi>becauſe 'is in effect to appeal to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for the Dean of the Arches before whom the Appeal muſt be brought is an Officer appointed by the Archbiſhop himſelf, and hath the ſame Iurisdiction with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſides, the Proctors there are not properly under any Viſitato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Power, they have a particular Iurisdiction within themſelves, and their Courts have been held in ſeveral places, as at</hi> Bow, Chriſtchurch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then as to the Cauſes of this removal 'tis returned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For receiving and proſecuting of a Cauſe without the advice of an Advocate contrary to a Statute made by the Archbiſhop</hi> Abbot.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For refuſing to pay</hi> 10 s. <hi>ſet upon him as a Tax towards the Charges of the Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now neither of theſe are ſufficient Cauſes to diſplace him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the firſt Cauſe, if that Statute gives them any ſuch Power 'tis void, becauſe it deprives a Man of his Freehold which cannot be done, but by the Law of the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis not ſaid when this Offence was committed, for it may be before a general Pardon, and then 'tis diſcharged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if it is an Offence, that will not make a Forfeiture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warning, and no ſuch thing appears upon the Return;</hi>
               <note place="margin">11 Co. 99. a.</note> 
               <hi>for if he had notice publickly, he might have offered ſomething in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of himſelf, as Sickneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which might have been allowed by the Court.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>'Tis as unreaſonable a Law to put the Clients to unneceſſary Charges to adviſe with an Advocate upon an ordinary Libel, as it would be for an Attorny of the</hi> King's Bench <hi>to adviſe with Council to draw a Declaration on a Bond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They do not ſhew by what Authority they may levy a Tax, neither do they ſet forth what Tax was made in the whole; ſo that it might appear that</hi> 10 s. <hi>was a proportionable part for him to pay; neither doth it appear when this Tax was made, or that Mr.</hi> Leigh <hi>was a Proctor when it was made.</hi>

            <p>E contra.
<note place="margin">E contra.</note> 
               <hi>This is not an Offence in matter of Iudgment, but 'tis a Misdemeanour and puniſhable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis very like the Caſe of Fellows of Colleges, who have proper Viſitors, and therefore the</hi> King's Bench <hi>will not grant a</hi> Mandamus <hi>in ſuch Caſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Proctor is an Officer of a Court different from the Courts of Law, and therefore the</hi> King's Bench <hi>cannot take notice of his Office judicially; they have no other way of puniſhing of a Proctor but by diſplacing of him; and if this ſhould be remedied by a</hi> Mandamus, <hi>then thoſe perſons may offend without puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis not like the Caſe of an Attorny, for he being an Officer of the</hi> King's Bench <hi>the Court doth judicially take notice of him, but not of a Proctor. 'Tis more like the Caſe of a Steward of a Court Baron, which is of private Iurisdiction, and for which a</hi> Mandamus <hi>hath been denied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis like</hi> Midleton<hi>'s Caſe, who was Treaſurer of the New River Water; 'tis true, a</hi> Mandamus <hi>was granted to reſtore him to that Office, but it was only</hi> de bene eſſe <hi>to bring the Matter before the Court, though that was a Corporation ſettled by Act of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis alſo like the Caſes of Abbots, Priors and Monks for whom a</hi> Mandamus <hi>was never granted, becauſe they are Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Corporations and have proper Viſitors, which is now by Law devolved upon the Archbiſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So alſo Lay Corporations have Viſitors which are their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and their Heirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis an Objection of no force to ſay that this Appeal muſt be to the Dean of the Arches, which is to appeal to the ſame perſon, becauſe though 'tis true that the Dean is conſtituted by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, yet when once he is inveſted with that Office he is in for his Life, and the Archbiſhop cannot afterwards come into that Court, and execute the Office of Dean himſelf, ſo he is not the ſame perſon, neither hath he the ſame Iurisdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="335" facs="tcp:37883:181"/>
            <p>Curia. <hi>A Proctor is not an Officer properly ſpeaking, 'tis only an Employment in that Court, which acts by different Laws and Rules from the</hi> King's Bench; <hi>they have an original Iurisdiction over this matter, and a</hi> Mandamus <hi>is in the nature of an Appeal, which will not be granted, where they have ſuch a Iuriſdiction, but when they exceed it and encroach upon the Common Law, then Prohibitions are granted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis for this reaſon that in caſes of Divorce which are of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nature than this caſe is, no Appeal can be to the</hi> King's Bench, <hi>for it would be an endleſs buſineſs for perſons to Appeal</hi> ab uno ad aliud examen, <hi>and therefore credit muſt be given to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe Courts, who have ſuch Original Iuriſdiction.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Now for a Church-Warden of a Pariſh, Clerk, an Attorny, or the like, all theſe are Temporal Officers, and are to be ordered by the Temporal Laws.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Offences which are the cauſes of the Forfeiture, are laid to be committed at the</hi> Fleet, <hi>by ſuffering Eſcapes, and by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, and 'tis not found where the</hi> Fleet <hi>is ſcituate, ſo there being no</hi> Viſne, <hi>thoſe Offences cannot be traverſed.</hi>
               </p>

<note place="margin">39 H. 6.32.</note> 
                  <hi>They do not find the Eſcape to be</hi> ſine licentia &amp; contra vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem <hi>of the Warden, the Debts being unpaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Admitting it to be a Forfeiture, the Office cannot go to the King, but it ſhall go to the next who hath the Inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:37883:182"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Opinion of the Court was, that there are two things which entitle the King to this Office, neither of which were found by this Inquiſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>An Eſtate in the Party offending.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A cauſe of Forfeiture of that Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now here was no Eſtate found in the Warden, but only that the Office was forfeited by ſuffering of Eſcapes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this had been an Office of Inheritance,</hi>

                     </gap> Co. 95.</note> 
                  <hi>then it ought to be found that ſuch a perſon was ſeiſed in Fee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſo what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſoever he had in it, ought to be expreſly found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But as this is found, 'tis void, becauſe it doth not anſwer the end for which the finding of Offices was provided, which is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title the King to the Offenders Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Indictment is but another ſort of Office, and here being no Eſtate found; 'tis much like an Indictment which finds no Offence, therefore it muſt be quaſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It might have been objected that no Man can tell what Eſtate the Warden had in this place, and that not being known, no Office could be found for the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this Objection runs to the finding of all manner of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in general, whoſe very nature is to find an Eſtate, and to diveſt the ſubject thereof and veſt it in the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides in this Caſe one of the Indentures by which the Office was granted to the Warden muſt be enrolled in the Court of</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Pleas.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> William Barker <hi>the Father by Leaſe and Releaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd the</hi> Reverſion <hi>to Sir</hi> William Barker, <hi>the now Plaintiff, that the Term was veſted in the Defendant, and aſſigns the breach for non-payment of the Rent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Defendant pleaded to the Iurisdiction of this Court, that the Lands in the Declaration mentioned lay in</hi> Ireland, <hi>where they have Courts of Record,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſo properly triable there.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The ſingle Queſtion was, whether an Aſſignee of the Reverſion can bring an Action of Covenant againſt the Aſſignee of a Leſſee in any other place than where the Land is.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He admitted that Debt upon a Leaſe for years upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it ſelf, and Covenant between the ſame Parties are tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Actions, and may be brought any where, but when once that</hi> privity of Contract <hi>is gone as by aſſignment of the Leſſee or the death of the Leſſor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Latch 197.</note> 
                  <hi>and there remains only a</hi> Privity in Law, <hi>there the Action muſt be brought in the County where the Land lieth; the reaſon is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hob. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the Party is then chargeable in reſpect of the poſſeſſion only.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore it was held that where an Aſſignee of a Reverſion of Lands in</hi> Sommerſetſhire, <hi>brought an Action of Debt in</hi> London,
<note place="margin">Cro. Car. 184. Jones 83. Dyer 40 b.</note> 
                  <hi>upon a Leaſe for years made there, reſerving a Rent payable at</hi> London, <hi>which was in arrear after the Aſſignment, that the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not well brought, for it ought to have been laid in</hi> Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſetſhire, <hi>where the Lands were, becauſe the</hi> privity of Contract <hi>was loſt by the aſſignment of the Reverſion, and therefore the Party to whom that aſſignment was made, ought to maintain the Action upon the</hi> privity in Law, <hi>by reaſon of the Intereſt which he had in the Land it ſelf, and that muſt be in the County where it lieth.</hi>

               <p>Curia. <hi>There is a difference between an Action of Debt for Rent brought by an Aſſignee, and an Action of Covenant, for the firſt is an Action at the Common Law, which hath fixed the Rent to the Reverſion, and therefore ſuch an Action muſt be maintained upon the Privity of Eſtate, which is always local.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But an Aſſigneé of a Reverſion could not bring an Action of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant at the Common Law,</hi>

                  <hi>for 'tis given to him by a particular Statute</hi> (viz.) <hi>of</hi> 32 H. 8. <hi>but the Statute did not transfer any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Contract to the Aſſignee, but the intent of it was to annex to the Reverſion ſuch Covenants only which concerned the Land it ſelf, as to repair the Houſe or amend the Fences, and not to anner or transfer any collateral Covenants, as to pay a Sum of Mony, for that is fixed by the Common Law to the Reverſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, At the Common Law an Aſſignee of a Reverſion might have maintained an Action of Covenant for any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to be done upon the Land it ſelf: Privity of Contract is not thereby transferred ſo as to make the Action tranſitory, but it muſt be brought upon the Privity of Eſtate; for if a Man doth covenant to do any collateral thing not in the Demiſe, and the Word</hi> Aſſignes <hi>is in the Deed, yet they are not bound if they have no Eſtate, ſo that 'tis not the naming of them, but by reaſon of the Eſtate in the Land, they are made chargeable.</hi>
